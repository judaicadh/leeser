                DISCOURSES JEWISH RELIGION. DISCOURSE I. THE GENIUS OF JUDAISM. O Lord God of our
                fathers &#33; whose wonders and whose mighty deeds are displayed over all thy
                works&#44; whose goodness feeds all creatures&#44; and whose provi&#8211; dence

                be&#44; in all our relations&#44; whether as individuals or members of the household
                of Israel. How gladly would we be Thine&#44; devoted to follow Thee&#44; obedient to
                thy will&#44; only that we are drawn aside by the cares of life&#44; and the
                temptations which the glare and glitter of worldly things place in our way. Let us
                entreat Thee there&#8211; fore to enlighten our eyes in thy law&#44; that we may be
                enabled&#44; by discerning what is good&#44; to do that only which is righteous in

                Father of mercy&#44; as the Guide who desires only the welfare of those who look to
                Ilim tor light and instruction &#59; for so shall we be safe from gross offences in
                our earthly pilgrimage&#44; and be numbered in good truth among those who have
                obeyed thy will&#44; in order that it may be well with us always. Amen. Brethren
                &#33; What is the genius&#44; the spirit of Judaism &#63; Every well&#8211;defined
                system has a principle on which it rests&#44; a centre around which it revolves&#59;
                and unless our religion should have sprung up by mere chance&#44; and be the
                accumulation of accidental principles engen&#8211; dered in the course of
                centuries&#44; and that thus it had no nucleus of its own&#44; but one by chance
                imagined for it in the gradual development it underwent in the slow progress of its
                assuming shape and form&#44; &#8212; it must have a pervading feature by which we
                could at once define it&#44; as contradistinguishing it from all others&#44; and
                which would stamp it as a premeditated legisla&#8211; tion&#44; resting on a
                well&#8211;established basis&#44; not the re&#8211; sult of accident&#44; but the
                forerunner of all the minor definitions required in the lapse of time to give it
                efficiency. Judaism&#44; we say therefore&#44; is not the re&#8211; sult of accident
                &#59; it did not take up its principles from causes not previously foreseen &#59;
                but it would be the same in its internal principles&#44; whether the world be new or
                old&#44; enlightened or barbarous. This does not say&#44; that its outward dress may
                not be subject to modification&#44; or even violent revolution&#59; but that when we
                come to ask what it radically is&#44; we must <pb n="3"/> THE GENIUS OF JUDAISM. 3
                not look to the outside appearance it presents&#44; not to the phases in the
                national history of those who pos&#8211; sess it&#44; but to the books in which its
                institutions are recorded&#44; and to the traces which it has left in history in its
                progress through past centuries. It has there&#8211; fore been found well adapted to
                all circumstances of society&#44; whether the agricultural or commercial &#59; to
                the state of freedom or slavery &#59; to one of peace or of war&#59; since in all
                conditions of life it steps in&#44; noise&#8211; lessly and soothingly&#44; to
                depress what is harsh and brutal&#44; to encourage what is sweet and humanizing in
                our nature. And why &#63; because its basis is love&#44; &#8212; love to God who has
                created us&#44; love to man who was created to be the image of God &#59; like wdiom
                we sprung from the earth&#44; like whom we are endowed with an intelligent soul&#44;
                like whom we are accountable for all our actions. No persecution of others&#44; no
                hatred of our fellows can be called consonant with our faith&#44; it is for each
                soul alone to feel its dependence on God. and if others do not feel the same&#44; we
                may pity them&#44; we may persuade them &#59; but never dare we hate&#44; dare we
                coerce&#44; dare we persecute them&#44; because they discern not like us the great
                Father in all walks of nature&#44; because they feel not like us their entire
                de&#8211; pendence on his bounty&#44; because they call not like us on his holy Name
                for aid and comfort in the hours of their tribulation. So many persons&#44; and
                perhaps Jews among others&#44; have charged against our relig&#8211; ion that it was
                also a persecuting one&#44; in agreement with that of the yazarenes and that of the
                Mahome&#8211; dans of our times&#59; they aver that we hunted down those differing
                from us&#44; and punished people for opin&#8211; ions&#39; sake. The deduction to be
                drawn from such <pb n="4"/> 4 THE GENIUS OF JUDAISM. assertions is&#44; that we have
                no right to complain if persecution be committed against us&#44; as we Lave only the
                poisoned chalice which we forced others to drain presented to our lips. Men say&#44;
                that we talk now of moderation&#44; because we are in a liopeless minority&#44; in
                consequence of which we have everything to gain and nothing to lose&#44; by our
                persuading others to es&#8211; tablish universal freedom of thought and action &#59;
                but that if we were back again in Palestine&#44; or were in an overwhelming majority
                in any other country&#44; we would soon teach the world that we could persecute and
                coerce by penal laws as well as all those&#44; whom we so energetically accuse of
                their offences against universal equality. Those who argue thus know not the history
                of our people&#44; and as little the genius of our religion. We are not sufficiently
                acquainted with the practical working of our ancient polity in the time of the first
                and second temples &#59; but there is no evidence deriva&#8211; ble from Scripture
                that the practice of the precepts of Judaism was enforced on
                non&#8211;Israelites&#44; not even the Sabbatic rest. We may concede that the public
                worship of idols was interdicted&#44; since no idolatrous image was permitted to
                remain in the land &#59; for&#44; inasmuch as the eradication of falsehood from the
                heart of the people was predicated on the removal of all that should bear a
                semblance to the practices of old Egypt or ancient Canaan&#44; their outward emblems
                could not be suffered to remain nor to be restored. Gross idolatry could therefore
                not be tolerated &#59; but only because the state was a commonwealth of the
                Lord&#44; of which He was the actual though invisible Chief&#44; who would not
                therefore tolerate the presence <pb n="5"/> THE GENIUS OF JUDAISM. 5 of objects
                avowedly contradicting bis autbority. Tbe Ten Commandments also say that the
                stranger shall rest on tbe Sabbath &#59; evidently however not to im&#8211; pose tbe
                burden of compulsory rest on bim&#44; but to absolve bim equally witli native
                Hebrews from a task of constant toil wbieb otherwise bis employers&#44; wbo may be
                Jews&#44; as well as others&#44; would impose upon bim. Understand well&#44; in
                heathen ideas there was no period of rest assigned to the bondman and tbe
                labourer&#44; except it be an occasional and periodical sea&#8211; son of gross
                licentiousness&#44; more calculated to brutal&#8211; ize than elevate the character
                of those who toil in tbe service of others. But now the law of Heaven stepped in
                between the masters and those bound to struggle in the various pursuits which make
                up the sum total of existence&#44; and told them&#44; &#34; You sball not exact
                constant labour from any one subject to your control&#44; whether it be the servant
                who dwells with you under the same roof&#44; or the hired stranger who&#44; having
                come from a distant country&#44; is compelled to look to you for means of employment
                that be may be able to earn bis livelihood in an honourable and independent
                manner&#44; by producing something with his own bands&#44; and not be compelled to
                look up to you for mere crumbs of charity which you might throw away on the idle and
                worthless sluggard.&#34; &#8212; I will prove to you&#44; brethren&#44; tbat this
                view is the only correct one of tbe injunction of tbe Ten Commandments which
                says&#58; &#34; Thou shalt not do any manner of work&#44; neither thou&#44; nor thy
                son&#44; nor thy daugbter&#44; thy servant&#44; nor thy maid&#8211;servant&#44; nor
                thy cattle&#44; nor thy stranger wbo is within thy gates.&#34; Here it says not
                &#34; the stranger&#44; &#34; which would include all sojourners in our 1&#42; <pb
                    n="6"/> 6 THE GENIUS OF JUDAISM. land&#44; every one whose clomicil might be in
                Palestine&#44; but &#34; thy stranger&#44; &#34; that is&#44; some one depending
                njjon an Israelite&#44; or else one who could be called in this connexion &#34;
                thy&#44; &#34; signifying a person belonging to the party addressed&#44; or
                here&#44; all Israel. But we are not left to mere inference which&#44; however
                ingenious&#44; might be deemed as unsound by those who may choose to dispute our
                view of the Hebrew commonwealth. For immediately after the promulgation of the
                Dec&#8211; alogue we are informed that Moses received the par&#8211; ticular laws of
                justice upon the basis of which the state was to be administered. Now one of these
                re&#8211; fers also to the Sabbath&#44; defining therefore the man&#8211; ner in
                which the general principle of Sabbatic rest was to be enforced. Let us therefore
                heed well what the law itself says&#44; or else we must evidenth&#39; go astray&#44;
                on the crooked path of conjecture. Eut these are the words&#58; &#34;Six days shalt
                thou do thy work&#59; but on the seventh day shalt thou rest &#40;more correctly
                abstain&#41; &#59; in order that thy ox and thy ass may have repose&#44; and the son
                of thy maid&#8211;servant and the stranger may be re&#8211; freshed.&#34; &#40;Exod.
                xxiii. 12.&#41; In reference to the ob&#8211; servance however of the sacred day of
                rest we have the following definition &#58; &#34; And thou shalt speak to the
                children of Israel saying. But indeed my Sab&#8211; baths shall ye observe&#44; for
                it &#40;meaning the institution of the day of rest&#41; is a sign between me and
                between you&#44; throughout your generations&#44; to know&#44; that I am the Lord
                who sanctify you. &#8212; And the children of Israel shall observe the Sabbath&#44;
                to make the Sab&#8211; bath thronghout their generations as an everlasting
                covenant.&#34; The penalty therefore denounced against its violation is not against
                the stranger who is not of <pb n="7"/> THE GENIUS OF JUDAISM. 7 the bouse of
                Israel&#44; but against tbose wbo entered into a covenant with the Lord by standing
                at the foot of Sinai&#44; saying&#44; &#34; All the words which the Lord hath spoken
                will we do.&#34; Whoever is&#44; accordingly&#44; of the descendants of Israel&#44;
                is bound by the mutual cove&#8211; nant between God and the nation that He chose as
                his own&#59; but whoever is not of them cannot be held to punishment for not
                observing the covenant&#44; in which he has no inherent interest&#44; unless he
                volun&#8211; tarily chooses to bind himself by a new obligation&#44; and to join
                himself to the born servants of the Most High. I do not wish you to take this on my
                own assertion &#59; but I will prove it for you from another portion of
                Scripture&#44; I mean the fifty&#8211;sixth chapter of Isaiah. The passage is in the
                following words &#58; &#34; Thus saitli the Lord&#44; Observe justice&#44; and do
                righteousness&#59; for near is my salvation to come&#44; and my righteousness to be
                revealed. Happy is the man that doeth this&#44; and the son of man who layeth hold
                thereon&#44; keeping the Sabbath not to violate it&#44; and keeping his hand from
                doing any kind of evil. And let not the son of the stranger who joineth himself unto
                the Lord say thus&#44; The Lord will surely sever me from his people&#59; for thus
                saith the Lord&#44; &#8212; And as regardeth the sons of the stranger&#44; who join
                themselves unto the Lord to serve Him&#44; and to love the name of the Lord&#44; to
                be unto Ilini as servants&#44; every one keeping the Sabbath not to vio&#8211; late
                it&#44; and laying all hold of my covenant &#58; even them will I bring to my lioly
                mountain&#44; and make them rejoice in my house of prayer&#59; their
                burnt&#8211;offerings and their sacrifices shall be favourably received on my altar
                &#59; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations.&#34; How
                many holy thoughts <pb n="8"/> 8 THE GENIUS OF JUDAISM. are excited in us when
                reading so much hope for man&#8211; kind&#44; for sincere belief&#44; for righteous
                action&#59; but we must pass all by to&#8211;day&#44; as it is merely to prove a
                single point that I cited the passage &#59; and it does es&#8211; tablish beyond a
                peradventurc&#44; that the stranger can only be held liable to the law by his own
                voluntary adoption thereof&#59; as it is a privilege to belong to the people of the
                Lord&#59; and if one wishes to be one of them&#44; he must seek the alliance&#44;
                and prove himself worthy through an observance of the precepts&#44; and no one can
                therefore force him to act as Israelites do&#44; nor&#44; what becomes evident of
                itself&#44; punish or perse&#8211; cute him for believing and acting
                difl&#39;erently from those belonging to the house of Israel. The stranger&#44; the
                prophet says&#44; shall not say in despair that the Lord will make a dividing line
                between him andliis people &#59; but he assures all that&#44; by joining themselves
                unto the Lord&#44; they can become his servants&#44; and be received equally with
                the born Hebrew before the Most High&#44; through faith and deeds&#44; of which
                latter the Sabbath is especially designated. IIow then can it be sup&#8211; posed
                that we were permitted to punish any non&#8211; Israelite&#44; during the existence
                of our state&#44; for not keeping the Sabbath&#63; The conclusion evidently is&#44;
                as I have stated&#44; the Sabbatic rest was enjoined towards the labouring
                gentile&#44; whether free or bond&#8211; man&#44; as a gracious privilege &#59; for
                inasmuch as he lived in. a state over which the Lord was King and Protec&#8211;
                tor&#44; he should participate in the rest of body and mind which was the
                characteristic mark of the land&#44; where no one could be held to toil for a
                master&#44; whether benevolent or cruel&#44; as soon as the setting of the sun on
                the sixth day announced that the Sab&#8211; <pb n="9"/> THE GENIUS OP JUDAISM. 9
                bath had thrown its mantle of repose and peace over the country in all its length
                and breadth. But if the stranger worked for himself&#44; quietly pursuing his
                avocations without inducing Israelites to violate the law &#58; where was the power
                to hold him criminally responsible for doing what he had not bound himself to
                observe&#44; by a voluntary joining himself unto the Lord &#63; Only then and thus
                became he a sou of Israel&#44; after choosing to be one of the covenant&#44; and
                accept&#8211; ing for himself the sweet burden of God&#39;s kingdom&#44; which we
                were chosen to bear from the very birth&#8211; day of our nation. No&#44;
                brethren&#44; persecution is not the watchword of Israel&#44; and they who charge us
                with it do not under&#8211; stand our history&#44; nor our law&#44; as I have
                already stated. The essence of God&#39;s government on earth is love&#44;
                universal&#44; all&#8211;pervading&#44; unending loving&#8211;kind&#8211; ness and
                mercy. IIow could his law then be other&#8211; wise than one of love&#44;
                kindness&#44; and mercy&#63; We obey only to be blessed &#59; we act only to receive
                the increased favour of God&#44; and whatever precept of our&#8211; religion we
                fulfil will only tend to cause an increase of our happiness. It would be
                preposterous to sup&#8211; pose that we could force such a system&#44; by the terror
                of the sword or civil disqualification&#44; upo&#8211;n those who did not
                voluntarily embrace it&#44; whilst it is freely given to the whole world&#44; whilst
                every human being is priv&#8211; ileged of becoming by adoption a member of our
                communion&#44; by which no worldly advantages can be secured&#44; no offices of
                trust or emolument be obtained&#44; only to be numbered as one of the people whom
                the Lord has selected as his peculiar treasure. Nor is it requisite for the
                salvation of the individual that he <pb n="10"/> 10 THE GENIUS OF JUDAISM. should be
                a professing Israelite&#59; since the Law was given solely to us as an inlieritance
                of the family of Jacob&#59; to be theirs as a gift of the Lord&#44; that they might
                be the witnesses of his glory&#44; power&#44; and unity&#59; consequently no one can
                be compelled to be&#8211; come one of the witnesses against his will &#59;
                where&#8211; fore his salvation does not depend upon it&#44; provided he carefully
                observes the precepts of universal appli&#8211; cability&#44; which God first
                promulgated to the family of yoah when they left the ark after the termination of
                the flood. The nature of our religion therefore pre&#8211; cluded us from
                persecuting non&#8211;Israelites for non&#8211; conformity&#44; and history may be
                challenged to prove that the practice of our people was ever the reverse of
                this.&#42; What is more&#44; however&#44; freedom of opinion was secured to all men
                &#59; for even Israelites could not be held to account for thoughts&#44; belief and
                opinions&#44; but solely for open acts against the sovereigntj&#8211; and majesty of
                God&#44; exhibited by a wilful transgression of the commandments. No such thing as
                an inquisi&#8211; tion into the faith could be tolerated or imagined even in the
                Jewish commonwealth&#44; for the very rea&#8211; son that no one was empowered to
                sit in judgment on the thoughts and private feelings of his brother. Understand
                well&#44; I do not saj&#8211;&#44; that punishment was not awarded for
                transgressions purely religious&#44; in contradistinction to those purely moral in
                their nature&#59; because the Bible would contradict such a statement&#44; and prove
                its falsehood. And this was also quite rea&#8211; sonable. For we must consider that
                the religion of the &#42; The conduct of Jolin Hyrcanus to circumcise the conquered
                Idumreaiis was against our laws&#44; and brought mischief in abun&#8211; dance in
                its train. <pb n="11"/> THE GENIUS OF JUDAISM. 11 Bible was also the civil law of
                the Israelites&#59; wherefore every citizen of the state was jSrmly held to its
                ob&#8211; servances&#44; and any infraction was viewed more in the light of a crime
                against the state than one against religion. &#8212; As&#44; however&#44; no
                state&#8211;crime can be prop&#8211; erly committed by thought&#44; so was unbelief
                not pun&#8211; ishable&#44; unless the conduct of the individual had become the
                exponent of his wicked thoughts&#44; or what is the same thing&#44; unless he had
                wilfully trangressed before witnesses some one or more of the deeds pro&#8211;
                hibited in the code of the land. So also was there no civil visitation for omitting
                to do the deeds re&#8211; Cjuired in Scripture &#59; for&#44; since the reward of
                them is not within the reach of human means&#44; and as the omis&#8211; sion of them
                adds nothing to the injury of mankind&#44; they were reserved for the Almighty&#44;
                to punish the dereliction as his wisdom and justice might demand. &#8212; To prove
                the existence of this freedom of thought among us&#44; we may refer to the section
                which we have read this day as a proof. The eighteenth chapter of Deuteronomy
                contains first several commandments relative to the rights of priests and
                Levites&#59; and next it prohibits superstitious practices in their various
                forms&#44; enjoining on Israelites to be true and perfect with the Lord&#44; to look
                up to Him for advice&#44; and wait patiently till He discloses by the event what his
                wise designs may be. He next states that such super&#8211; stitions as are now
                prohibited had been the custom of the nations of Canaan&#44; whom they were soon to
                drive out from their land&#59; but that the Israelites had received a different
                portion&#44; because God would raise up to them from time to time prophets&#44; who
                should be like Moses&#44; faithfully speaking to the people the <pb n="12"/> 12 THE
                GENIUS OF JUDAISM. messages wliieh they may have received from tlie Lord of
                life&#44; the Fountain of all knowledge&#59; giving as a reason that they had asked
                for a messenger to communicate to them the will of God&#44; at the time that they
                beheld the great lire at lloreb&#44; and heard the fearful voice of their God. The
                text then says&#44; that the Lord would raise up a prophet to Israel from among
                their own brethren&#44; like unto Moses&#44; in whose mouth God would place his
                word&#44; and who should speak all that the Lord would command him to pro&#8211;
                claim. Nevertheless we are told &#58; &#34; And it shall come to pass that&#44;
                whoever will not hearken to my words which he &#40;the prophet&#41; shall speak in
                my name&#44; I will re&#8211; quire it of him.&#34; Deut. xviii. 19. But the prophet
                who should presume to speak falsely in the name of God&#44; or who should speak in
                the name of false gods&#44; should die for his iniquity. This now opens to us&#44;
                if properly and fully pur&#8211; sued&#44; a wide field of inquiry&#59; but we must
                confine ourselves to illustrate but one branch of the many which the text aftbrds.
                We cannot well imagine a greater disrespect to the Deity than a non&#8211;attention
                to a message which He may communicate to the world. Still we are warned not to lay
                hand on the open unbeliever&#59; because courts of justice have re&#8211; ceived no
                commission to avenge any thought&#44; what&#8211; ever it may be&#44; so long as
                acts do not make it evident and cognizable to all. But observe&#44; if one should
                presume to speak falsely in the name of God&#44; thereby <pb n="13"/> THE GENIUS OF

                impressing the people with a belief in what he says&#44; he would produce and
                propagate injurious errors&#44; and sap the foundation of the divine state&#44;
                which is based on truth and revelation. The revelation I mean&#44; is the public
                announcement of the Law on Sinai&#44; which was made the basis of the code which God
                gave after&#8211; wards to Israel &#58; now as God is true and his word is
                unchanging&#44; all departure from this standard can only produce happiness to the
                individual citizen and injury to the state. Wherefore it is mercy to all that the
                seducer should be put away&#44; so that he may not have a farther opportunity to
                entice his hearers from the God W&#39;ho has redeemed us from Egypt. Indi&#8211;
                vidual unbelief can only afl&#39;ect the culprit himself&#44; hence though he
                sins&#44; he only offends his Maker&#59; he therefore justly reserves to himself the
                punishment of a crime resting between God and man. But when&#44; on the other
                hand&#44; the foundations and peace of so&#8211; ciety are attempted to be
                disrupted&#44; it is the state which of right takes cognizance of the treason&#44;
                and punishes the culprit with the utmost severity known to the law. That thus Jews
                may possibly have been punished at some period of our history for the very
                transgression here mentioned&#44; for teaching things in the name of God which He
                had not spoken&#44; or for speaking in the name of gods not known to our law&#44;
                may be freely confessed&#44; without its being chargeable to us that we were

                well&#8211;defined crime &#59; and in our state&#44; where the Lord was the
                chief&#44; no greater crime could be imagined than lowering Him in the estimation of
                the people&#44; over whom He ruled as Sovereign&#44; and who had re&#8211; ceived at
                his hands the law of life&#44; and all the good which they so abundantly enjoyed. It
                was the love for the community which caused the individual to be punished&#59; it
                was the rights of each which were pro&#8211; tected wdien the transgressions were
                repressed by wholesome punishments. Our history shows abun&#8211; dantly the evil
                con seque&#8211;nces of false teachings&#59; hence we justify the doom which the law
                destined for those who failed here in their duty. Would to mercy&#33; that we had
                always maintained a strict distinction between freedom of opinion in the single
                man&#44; and the cul&#8211; pability of the teachers of falsehood. Never should we
                have wandered from our home&#44; never sliould we now mourn over our dispersion in
                far and distant lands. But herein too we deemed ourselves wiser than our laws&#44;
                we elevated ourselves above the stand&#8211; ard of the Scriptures&#58; and the
                errors which the wicked taught found an echo in the hearts of the transgressors&#44;
                by which our state fell&#44; and our multi&#8211; tudes were slain. It is only from
                God and through his mercy that we have been preserved alive&#44; and that&#44;
                despite of the advocates of lalsehood and error&#44; we .arc undiminished and

                fallen state&#63; what is he when he is again reconciled to God &#63; These are
                important questions&#44; which it behoves us well to consider&#44; on which we must
                ponder with deep anxiety if we wish to solve the problem of our existence. Well did
                the ancient Rabbi say&#44; &#34; I was only created to serve my Maker&#59;&#34; but
                when man forgets his God&#44; and neg&#8211; lects the duties which his Father has
                prescribed&#44; he evidently misses the aim and object of his being. When first we
                open our eyes to the beauty of God&#39;s creation&#44; we are in a state of
                purity&#44; free from sin&#44; free from guilt&#44; free from the consequence of
                trans&#8211; gression &#59; we arc at peace with Heaven&#44; and in har&#8211; mony
                with mankind. The balance of nature has not then been invaded by our wrongdoing&#44;
                and our sleep is sound&#44; our dreams are peaceful &#59; because our soul feels not
                the discord between our acts and the beauty of what the Lord has called forth to
                till the earth with beatitude and gladness. But as we advance in life this primitive

                The very awakening to this con&#8211; sciousness tolls the death&#8211;knell of
                infantine purity &#59; and with it commences the active wai&#8211;fiire between
                spirit and matter&#44; between the brute nature and the sublime man&#44; the image
                of God wliich dwells within us. Whatever be the reason of our twofold forma&#8211;

                you&#44; one feeling urging you on to the deed pictured forth in your mind&#44; the
                other imploring you to desist. If you are suddenly impelled to give charity&#44;
                your avarice begs you to re&#8211; strain your hand&#44; and to drop again into your
                well&#8211; tilled purse the mite you first meant to devote to the relief of the
                indigent brother before you &#59; it tells you of your own wants&#44; of the demands
                of those in your house on your frugality and prudence&#44; and it persuades you that
                all gifts not bestowed on you and yours will ultimately impoverish you. Again&#44;
                let your anger be roused against your fellow&#8211;man&#44; and you are ready to
                strike with the fist of wickedness the helpless oflfender&#44; or to wound yet more
                him whom your strong arm has overthrown &#58; and a still soft voice will counsel
                you to restrain the uplifted hand&#44; or to sheathe the half&#8211;drawn
                dagger&#44; inasmuch as it is not for man to avenge himself on his brother&#44; or
                to redress his wrong by the strength of his own arm. It is this double heart which

                that of the Lord alone. But this is not all&#59; reason would teach that if we had
                so glo&#8211; rious a destiny&#44; and we had thrown it away by vain indulgence and
                idle dissipation&#44; we must have for&#8211; feited all claim to it by our unwise
                conduct. Religion&#44; however&#44; steps in with an assurance of life even
                here&#44; and tells that heaven can be regained&#44; though it was lost by
                transgression &#59; that an ofiended Father can be reconciled by the contrition of
                the erring child. There is presented to us&#44; in the words of our faith&#44; no
                reser&#8211; vation about an inexorable justice which must needs be gratified by the
                death of him who is guilty of death&#59; but we are told that God is &#34;merciful

                misdeeds&#44; and the long&#8211;suffering Father will forgive&#44; because He
                delights in pardoning. The question&#44; however&#44; arises&#58; &#34; How is this
                to be effected&#63; is a man to sin&#44; and yet not be punished&#63; is he to defy
                the law&#44; and yet escape unscathed&#63;&#34; Far from it&#59; because our

                &#40;Ezek. xviii. 4.&#41; But it is solely the un regenerate soul&#44; the
                obdu&#8211; rate will&#44; that calls down for visitation &#59; since only for the

                indulges in the base pursuit of earthly gain&#44; aggrandizement&#44; and
                pleasure&#44; his spirit is&#44; as was said already&#44; in a state of warfare with
                God&#44; in a constant opposition to the interests of mankind. When he now awakens

                &#34; There is peace&#44; there is peace to him that is far&#44; and to him that is

                ris&#8211;hteous&#8211; ness will be repaired&#44; the distance which his sins had
                placed between him and his Maker will be lessened&#44; and he will be accepted again
                as one in whom the Father of all finds delight&#44; the beloved child who is again
                received with joy&#44; after a long absence&#44; in the peaceful halls of his
                paternal mansion. In this scheme of repentance there is justice gratified&#44;
                though no punishment is meted out. God punishes only to amend&#44; to admonish the
                erring child that the path <pb n="24"/> 24 THE WORK OF REGENERATION. trodden is one
                of danger and death&#59; if&#44; therefore&#44; the sinner returns to Ilim in
                sincerity and truth&#44; the de&#8211; mands of justice are of themselves
                satisfied&#44; since the effect of retribution is attained without their aid. To say
                that&#44; without an atonement actually offered&#44; God cannot forgive&#44; is not
                only contradicting his supreme power&#44; as we would discover it through means of
                our reason&#44; but is in evident contradiction to his declared will&#44; and the
                knowledge He proclaimed of himself. He taught us that He will forgive any and every
                of&#8211; fence&#44; if we but return to Him&#44; and obey his voice &#40;Deut. iv.
                29&#44; 30&#41;&#44; because He our God is merciful&#44; not because He has been
                appeased through sacrifice or punishment. It is true He also declares in another
                passage &#40;Exod. xxxiv. 7&#41;&#44; that He will suffer no guilt to pass
                unrequited &#58; but&#44; in the first place&#44; this may refer to the
                unatoned&#8211;for man&#44; to the unrepentant sinner&#44; who passes through life
                without being converted back to God &#59; and secondly&#44; even admitting that it
                refers to all sins&#44; still it will not be asserted that no salva&#8211; tion can
                be purchased by man through repentance &#59; requiting one for a wrong done&#44; is
                an entirely differ&#8211; ent idea from rejecting him altogether&#44; or asking of
                him something more than is in his power to accom&#8211; plish. When the Father
                punishes a disobedient child&#44; he corrects him only that he may be improved
                there&#8211; by&#59; and even so when God requites our sins&#44; it is only to
                chastise&#44; and thereby to improve the heart. He could not mean in calling himself
                merciful and long&#8211; suffering&#44; to contradict himself in the next verse&#44;
                and assert that every sin should be followed by entire con&#8211; demnation &#59;
                reason might indeed demand it&#44; as we have said already&#44; since every
                departure from the <pb n="25"/> THE WORK OF REGENERATION. 25 strict rule of right
                is&#44; when purposely done&#44; a wilful disregard of the divine authority. But we
                are not left to the guidance of naked reason&#59; we are under the teachings of
                God&#39;s holy Spirit itself&#44; and therefore we speak of Him not as we would
                picture Him by un&#8211; aided reason&#44; but as He has taught us to regard
                Him&#44; that is&#44; as the One who is infinite in mercy and good&#8211; ness&#44;
                who will not be wroth forever&#44; nor contend to everlasting&#44; so soon as the
                spirit is humbled before Him&#44; and the souls that He has made are grieved.
                &#40;Corap. with Isaiah Ivii. 16.&#41; This exhibits to us the doctrine for which
                Jews have always contended&#44; in accordance with the express words and spirit of
                the Scripture&#44; that life and death were surrendered to our own choice at the
                time we were endowed with liberty of conscience&#44; and empowered to choose between
                good and evil. We have the disposition to do what is wrong&#44; also the power to
                control this sinful propen&#8211; sity&#44; while we are in a comparative state of
                innocence&#59; so also have we the remedy&#39; given us to amend sin&#44; and to
                atone for it in our own persons&#44; when we have thoughtlessly&#39; yielded
                ourselves to iniquity. &#34;Were it that another could assume our guilt&#44; or that
                in no other manner could salvation be procured&#44; there would have been a positive
                doctrinal revelation of this sort imparted to us. This&#44; however&#44; is not the
                case&#59; in one instance&#44; it is said&#44; &#34; Even I&#44; even I&#44; blot
                out thy transgression for my sake&#44; and thy sins will I not re&#8211;
                member&#59;&#34; in another it is said&#44; &#34;The soul that sin&#8211; neth shall
                die&#59;&#34; consequently there is no power to save the sinner from the indignation
                of God&#44; except by the remedy which He also indicated&#44; that is&#44; a
                thorough repentance and an amendment of conduct. VOL. VIII. 3 <pb n="26"/> 26 THE
                WORK OF REGENERATION. In this spirit does Ezekiel teach&#44; in the same chap&#8211;
                ter wherein he exliorts the sinner that he must perish for his wrongdoing&#44; that
                the death demanded is not absolutely the consequence of iniquity&#44; since it is in
                the power of man to cause a revocation of the evil decree. And thus speaks the
                prophet &#58; &#34; And the wicked&#44; if he turneth from all the sins which he
                hath done&#44; and observeth all my statutes&#44; and doth justice and
                righteous&#8211; ness&#44; shall live&#44; he shall not die.&#34; Ezek. xviii. 21.
                The death&#44; therefore&#44; annexed to crime&#44; is also re&#8211; moval at the
                option of the transgressor&#44; since re&#8211; pentance is the antidote to what we

                ECHO OF THE PROPHETS. DISCOURSE III. AN ECHO OF THE PROPHETS. O Thou &#33; whose
                blessing covers the fields with plenty&#44; and crowns the trees with the swelling
                fruit&#44; have mercy on thy flock&#44; the people whom Thou hast chosen&#44; and
                fill their granaries with thy bounty &#59; and let thy plentifulness attend all
                their labours in the city and the field&#44; and command for them success when they
                come in and when they go out &#59; so that they may not need the aid of flesh of
                blood&#44; but be fed solely from thy hand&#59; that their food may come in
                abundance before they need it&#44; and their garments be ready for them in season
                before they require them. Thus will they be relieved from the slavery of de&#8211;
                pendence on man&#44; and their mind will be free from the interruption of anxious
                care for their daily bread&#44; and they will have leisure to devote themselves to
                thy service&#44; that it may be well with them and their families always&#59;
                inasmuch as Thou blessest those who fear Thee&#44; and leavest not those unpKotected
                who seek thy aid in the sincerity of their heart. Yea&#44; be with us whilst we
                sojourn on thy earth&#44; and leave us not without opportunities to earn thy favour
                in the world to come&#44; in the life without end or shadow&#44; where the righteous
                live forever&#44; and bask unceasingly in the holy light of thy countenance&#44;
                which is the desire of the angels and the holy ones whom Thou hast created. Amen.
                    <pb n="31"/> AN ECHO OF THE PROPHETS. 31 Brethren &#33; What is our mission as
                Jews &#63; what is it as men &#63; From a superficial view we might imagine that
                there existed a difference in the two problems thus pre&#8211; sented to us&#59; but
                if we look deeper into the subject&#44; we will discover that both melt into
                one&#44; and have the self&#8211;same end to be reached in solving them prop&#8211;
                erly. Let us take a text from the prophet Ezekiel as the basis of our
                contemplation&#44; on which to establish the superstructure which we desire to see
                exhibited before us. We read in the section appointed to be read as appropriate for
                this day&#44; as follows &#58; &#34; And I will exalt and sanctify myself&#44; and I
                will be naanifested in the sight of many nations &#59; and they shall know that I am
                the Lord.&#34; Ezek. xxxviii. 23. It is here declared that the Lord intends
                displaying his power and holiness before the eyes of the masses of mankind who
                compose the nations&#44; that they may thereby learn to discover that He is indeed
                the Su&#8211; preme Ruler&#44; the sole Creator. and Preserver of all things&#44;
                and that no other power exists besides Him&#44; or can maintain itself in opposition
                to his decrees. This is the will of God &#59; this is the view of the future which
                is revealed to us &#58; and though the time may be far distant&#44; it is well
                defined in the dark recesses of coming events&#44; which are laid open only to Him
                who sees alike the past&#44; present&#44; and future&#59; whose exist&#8211; ence is

                therefore has all possible existence spread out before Ilim&#44; and nothing escapes
                his all&#8211;seeing eye. But though we cannot see the end of things&#44; we can at
                least labour to prorAote its arrival bj our feeble hu&#8211; man aid. It is true we
                are mortal &#8212; our very breath is drawn in pain and sorrow&#59; we are ignorant
                of the consequences of the very steps which we take. Never&#8211; theless&#44; we
                have a mission&#44; an appointment in the world&#44; which we must and can pursue in
                accordance with the great plan of the universal Father&#44; for the promotion of his
                kingdom and the establishing of the knowledge of himself&#44; which we are tokl by
                his prophets it is his purpose to diffuse among all man&#8211; kind. To suppose that
                we are here merely for our&#8211; selves&#44; &#8212; that we can&#44; if we
                would&#44; stand still in the path of life without regarding the masses around
                us&#44; &#8212; would presuppose that a man could be independent&#44; isolated in
                life&#44; without sympathy&#44; without influence. But the most cursory observation
                contradicts this&#58; everybody receives and conveys impression&#94;&#44; and it is
                questionable whether even an idiot is without some influence on others. We know not
                how ideas are excited&#59; we know as little how they are conveyed abroad to
                others&#44; nor where the starting&#8211;point is whence new thoughts are carried
                into the channels formerly overrunning with those of a diftcrent or opposite
                nature&#59; consequently we cannot&#8211; determine who and what are the best
                instruments whom the Lord may select to eflect his purposes. The Psalmist says&#44;
                &#34; The stone which the builders despised hath become the chief
                corner&#8211;stone&#59;&#34; and in the same strain may we allege that the humblest
                individual&#44; only if he be blest by his Sender&#44; can eflfect that good <pb

                of attain&#8211; ing. Let us&#44; therefore&#44; he ever so little in our eyes or
                those of the world&#44; we may still say&#44; witiiout being guilty of arrogance or
                undue pride&#44; that we have been selected for a wise purpose to be God&#39;s
                witnesses&#59; and&#44; what is more&#44; we may maintain that our labours will
                succeed&#44; and that though now the fewest of na&#8211; tions&#44; as we have
                always been since our tirst selection&#44; the time will come when we shall become
                &#34;praised&#44; famed&#44; and glorious&#44; as also a holy people to the Lord our
                God&#44; as He hath spoken&#59;&#34; since the Almighty&#39;s will never fails of
                working out its own purposes&#44; let the fulfilment be delayed even so long&#44;
                that men in their blind ignorance say that the time will never arrive&#59; because
                we know that his are not eyes of flesh&#44; and that He does not work as men work
                &#59; for all power is his&#44; and time and eternity are before Him alike. We have
                now a twofold proposition before us&#58; God purposes a universal sanctification of
                all man&#8211; kind&#44; and that we shall be his instruments. The first idea is one
                of vast and far&#8211;reaching importance&#44; noth&#8211; ing less than the whole
                human race being included&#59; the second merely regards the instruments &#58; and
                who can say of them with justice to the great Master &#8212; &#34; Thy labourers are
                not worthy of thy grace &#63;&#34; Truly may we confess the latter mortifying fact
                to our shame. We have received a high destiny&#44; &#8212; still we have valued more
                the gewgaws and glitter of the world&#44; than the favour of Heaven and the
                promotion of the objects of our mission &#33; JSTevertheless&#44; this does not
                impeach the wisdom of our God&#44; nor say that his intentions will ultimately prove
                fruitless. <pb n="34"/> 34 AN ECHO OF THE PROPHETS. For&#44; as he said through his
                prophet&#44; his word will not return again from the earth without prospering in
                that&#44; for which He has sent it&#44; as little as the rain and snow fail in
                fructifying the earth. The question then recurs&#44; What are we to do as God&#39;s
                missionaries &#63; how act as individual Israelites &#63; Even as the Lord has
                commanded us in his law&#59; and in doing so we fulfil in the best manner our own
                call&#8211; ing as members of the divine household&#44; and as mes&#8211; sengers of
                good tidings to all the earth. As indi&#8211; viduals we are children of
                salvation&#44; of a beatitude unspeakably glorious&#44; interminally enduring. To
                obtain this&#44; we must be active in doing good&#44; cour&#8211; ageous in subduing
                our passions&#44; attentive in learn&#8211; ing what the All&#8211;father has taught
                us &#59; and only when we have to the utmost learned our duty&#44; struggled with
                our baser nature&#44; and wrought well in the task of beneficence and holiness&#44;
                can we say that we have well&#8211;grounded hopes that our God will approve our
                service&#44; and accept us in his presence&#44; and place us within his sanctuary as
                those who have fulfilled his holy behests &#59; who have walked humbly&#44; because
                He is high &#59; who have mastered their pas&#8211; sions&#44; because He had taught
                tliem the right way &#59; and who have laboured for the good of mankind&#44;
                be&#8211; cause He who loves all his creatures had so com&#8211; manded them to be
                merciful to all those to whom lie is merciful. In this individual striving for
                holiness because our God is holy&#44; there is no selfish egotism&#44; no hating of
                those who are less righteous&#59; because even they&#44; who are far below us in the
                scale of merit&#44; are nevertheless&#44; not less than we&#44; creatures of the
                same Creator&#44; amenable to Him&#44; not to us&#44; for the <pb n="35"/> AN ECHO

                has transferred to us the right of sitting in judgment on their transgressions&#44;
                or the good of society de&#8211; mands that they should be punished as criminals
                whose deeds may countervene the general welfare. This latter condition can&#44;
                however&#44; not affect those acts which may be termed deeds of piety&#44; in which
                man acts only in relation to God&#44; without thereby doino&#8211; anythino&#39;
                which affects mankind at lar&#94;e. In these&#44; therefore&#44; no man has a right
                to interfere as avenger of the Most High&#44; unless special permission has been
                delegated&#44; and then it must be solely be&#8211; cause it is commanded&#44; not
                for man to say that he assumes the right to judge the conscience of his fel&#8211;
                low&#8211;mortal. You will therefore observe in our whole law no ojnnion surrendered
                to the power of the judges&#59; acts&#44; open deeds only&#44; as being matters of
                evidence to the eyes and ears&#44; could be investigated by the tri&#8211;
                bunals&#44; and they could only then condemn&#44; when the guilt was so clearly
                established&#44; that the accused him&#8211; self could not do otherwise than admit
                the justice of the verdict&#44; without being called upon in the first place to
                criminate himself by the words of his own mouth. It is accordingly our duty to be as
                righteous as we can &#59; we must daily endeavour to be active in our persons to do
                acts of holiness and benevolence&#44; and to improve our mind with such knowledge
                and contemplations as will bring God present to our soul&#44; by which the fear of
                Him will become deeper and deeper impressed on our spirit&#44; by which means again
                we shall learn daily better how to follow his guid&#8211; ance &#58; because we then
                shall know that all which He <pb n="36"/> 36 AN ECHO OF THE PROPHETS. asks of us is
                for our own happiness&#44; that it may be well with us all the days. Now as the holy
                law gives us no other duties to perform as a nation than those which are prescribed
                to the individual&#44; one thing follows&#44; that as God&#39;s missionaries we have
                to pursue the same course as we do in character of candidates for salvation. If as
                the latter we are to endeavour to acquire the utmost attainable perfection&#44; and
                to love our fellows with a sincere affection&#44; serve them without hopes of
                reward&#44; and not molest them though they differ from us in conduct and
                opinion&#44; except with the sole limitation already mentioned&#58; &#8212; it
                follows accordingly that&#44; in our position as God&#39;s witnesses&#44; we must be
                holy in our persons&#44; consistent in our conduct&#44; but at the same time active
                in serving all whom our acts can at all benefit&#44; and be only courageous in
                defending the truth when it is assailed&#44; without ever daring to hate
                mankind&#44; or what is still worse&#44; force them by per&#8211; secutions and
                penal laws to adopt our mode of think&#8211; ing&#44; or to act as we do in
                obedience to the law which we liave received. It may therefore deeply grieve you to
                see our holy Sabbath universally violated by men&#58; yet you have no right to
                compel them to rest&#59; as the day was only given as a sign between the Creator and
                Israel&#44; that we might thereby acknowl&#8211; edge that we believe in Him as the
                Originator of the world. Whereas now this command has not been given to the nations
                of the earth&#44; what is it to us that they know not the rest of the Lord&#63; Let
                us bless liis providence for having pointed out to us the way of light&#44; and let
                us not hate nor coerce those who have not been so instructed in the duties which
                were first <pb n="37"/> AN ECHO OF THE PROPHETS. 37 given to our fathers. Where was
                the force which the Almighty employed in teaching us the law&#63; Were there not
                sixty times ten thousand freemen who ac&#8211; cepted voluntarily to serve their
                eternal Benefactor&#63; Whence then the right to hate and persecute those who differ
                from us&#63; But no&#59; the greater the igno&#8211; rance of the world in matters
                of holiness&#44; the greater should be our charity towards all. It is only by mercy
                that God acquired us for his portion&#59; it is only there&#8211; fore by the same
                means that hearts can be won by his servants. &#34;But how is this to be
                effected&#63;&#34; will be the next question. This is not so easy of solution&#44;
                because herein the Bible gives us but few indications&#44; and examples are not
                numerous of the intercourse of the prophets with the gentiles&#44; to act as a firm
                guide in this perplexing matter. That through us all the na&#8211; tions of the
                earth are to be blessed&#44; as God foretold to Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; and
                Jacob&#44; and repeated again through Moses&#44; is not for a moment to be doubted.
                The idol&#8211;worship may be rooted ever so deeply&#59; the idol&#8211;temples may
                stand ever so firmly&#59; but the one will vanish and the other will be rendered
                desolate&#44; and all through our agency&#59; because Isaiah says&#44; in his
                chapter xliii. verse 21 &#58; &#34; This people have I formed for myself&#59; they
                shall declare my praise.&#34; But whether this is to be effected by our simple
                pres&#8211; ence on earth&#44; or by our ultimately standing forward as missionaries
                in the glorious work of the regeneration of the world&#44; does not so clearly
                appear. But from the example of the prophets&#44; with the sole exception of
                Jonah&#44; we should say that they never acted as actual missionaries to the
                gentiles&#59; and in his in&#8211; VOL. VIII. 4 <pb n="38"/> 38 AN ECHO OF THE
                PROPHETS. stance&#44; too&#44; it was not to convert the people of Nin&#8211; eveh
                to the faith of Israel&#44; hut to warn them against the violence and injustice
                which had hcen committed there&#44; acts against which the simple moral law first
                given to Noah already energetically bore a testimony of condemnation. Still the
                mission of Jonah proves not only that the nations of the East in those times knew of
                the Lord and confided in his proyhets&#44; &#8212; which was also exemplified in the
                case when Ben&#8211;Hadad sent his general to consult the prophet Elisha&#44; who
                was then at Damascus&#44; but that the Lord himself has not relin&#8211; quished
                caring for the welfare of the nations of the earth&#44; because lie has selected our
                people as his pecu&#8211; liar treasure&#44; and that their salvation is surely
                within his intentions&#44; and that in his own time they will be all gathered to his
                fold. But it is also certain that Ave have not received any special command to
                preach the law and the testimony to others than Israelites&#44; while we were
                especially exhorted not alone to be faithful each to his trust&#44; but to teach our
                children that they might learn to fear the Lord. We may therefore deduce from all
                this that&#44; till a special call shall be made on us&#44; we are to abstain from
                seeking to convert others to our faith &#8212; not to reject those who voluntarily
                join themselves to the house of Jacob&#44; for purs is a universal house of
                prayer&#44; and all who wish are welcome to enter thither and adore the Father of
                mercy. But it would appear oidy that&#44; under the present circumstances of the
                world&#44; we are not to go abroad to seek to make converts to our religion&#44; but
                to await quietly and hopefully the time of the&#39;uni&#8211; versal adoption of the
                yoke of Heaven. This&#44; how&#8211; ever&#44; does not say that our ideas will not

                the records of history. The Bible was first ours in the vernacular tongue of our
                people&#59; and now see how it has been multiplied in the languages of almost every

                they acknowledge that w&#8211;e are the first&#8211;born of the Lord in the faith.
                It is also true that they have been the most inveterate foes of Jacob&#39;s

                philanthropists. This has been the achievement of a three centuries&#39; possession
                of the Scriptures&#44; of a book preserved by us with jealous care&#44; watched over
                with more than a maternal fondness&#44; so that no error or interpolation might
                creep in to dim the bright surface of the divine mirror&#44; in which we see

                day when He shall be acknowledged as One&#44; and the world will adore the Eternal
                One alone&#44; and lie be called One in the month of all flesh&#44; as He is now
                invoked in the assemblies of Israel. Now errors in politics and religion sow discord
                and dissen&#8211; sions among mankind &#59; injustice and ignorance as yet inflict
                their evils on the helpless&#44; and even those who bear rule on earth. But are we
                to say that no farther change is yet to be wrought &#63; that now all has been
                accomplished of which man is capable &#63; that the sighs of the oppressed are never
                to cease &#63; Yet as regards the Scriptures&#44; they emphatically declare that a
                new state of things shall be brought about in the first place for Israelites as the
                possessors of God&#39;s word&#44; and then for the gentiles&#44; who are to be
                brought un&#8211; der the same banner which has so long waved over us&#44; &#8212;
                and all analogy proves that these promises could not have been made in vain. Now in
                conclusion we come to the point of Jewish teachers of righteousness to the gentiles.
                This too the prophet Isaiah foresaw in his second chapter&#44; when he says &#58;
                &#34; For from Zion shall go forth the law&#44; and the word of the Lord from
                Jerusalem.&#34; Consequently it is the intention of the Lord that through our means
                a direct instruction is to come to pass among the gentiles. But we are nevertheless
                left in doubt whether they are solely to come&#44; as there indicated&#44; to the
                house of God to be taught&#44; or wheth&#8211; er we are to travel over the earth to
                convert it&#44; in the first instance. Whatever be the ultimate destiny of our
                race&#44; however&#44; is a mere matter of speculation&#44; as far as this point is
                concerned &#59; should it be time for <pb n="43"/> WALKING BEFORE GOD. 43 US to be

                our destiny &#59; for the spirit that once spoke through Moses is yet potent and
                undiminished in vigour. In the mean&#8211; time it is evidently our duty to sanctify
                the name of the Lord&#44; to exhibit by a consistent religious conduct the beauties
                of holiness as imposed on us through obedience to the law. In this way will the
                world see the fructifying effects of an enliglitened religion&#44; free from
                fanatical zeal&#44; free from mysticism&#59; and men will be drawn aside from
                error&#44; and strive to obtain wisdom from the Word that dwells with us &#59; and
                thus will we pave the way for God&#39;s kingdom&#44; and preach by our silent
                example eloquent lessons of godliness and truth&#44; and we shall bring near the

                ever watched over us&#44; from the day that Abraham went forth from his father&#39;s
                house until this hour&#44; and we are here to bless thy Name. Be with us then in
                this generation also&#44; and let the new war of opinions pass over us and leave us
                unharmed&#44; as when Thou commandedst the destroyer to stay his hand when Thou
                wentest forth to smite the first&#8211;born of Egypt. ISTot on our wisdom do we rely
                to save the flock from the jaws of the devourer&#59; for our best knowledge is but
                foolishness before Thee&#59; only on thy light and aid do we depend for support&#44;

                dark will be rendered clear&#44; and all doubts be removed by the wisdom which is in

                old&#44; God appeared to him and spoke to him these remarkable words &#58; &#34; I

                other motive as the foundation of religion &#59; and as this has not been done&#44;
                we may be sure that the cause assigned is the real basis of righteousness. &#34;VVe

                different mental qualities arising from different sources of action &#59; whereas
                they are all referable&#44; in their pure state&#44; to one single principle&#44;
                and this the fear&#44; and consequent love of God&#59; and the deeper we have
                entered into the absolute venera&#8211; tion of our heavenly Father&#44; the greater
                will be the distinction between us and those who do not fear Him&#44; in all that
                ennobles and elevates the human character. The Almighty therefore placed before
                Abraham a high aim&#44; and assigned hira a reason for pursuing it to the end of his
                life. It is&#44; &#34; Walk before me and be thou perfect&#44; &#34; because that He
                the Lord &#34; is the Almighty God.&#34; To express a God&#8211;pleasing course&#44;
                the Scriptures use the phrases &#34; walking with&#44; &#34; &#34; be&#8211;
                fore&#34; and &#34; after God&#44; &#34; all having the meaning to follow out the
                path which the Lord ordains&#44; which again means to do all the acts which are
                pleasing to Hira&#44; and to avoid all those which He calls evil. You know already
                that the revelation of his will&#44; com&#8211; municated to the world at various
                periods&#44; gives us the knowledge of these respective actions&#58; and when
                therefore it is said that such a one walked with God&#44; or the like&#44; we shall
                at once understand that he was obedient to all the duties which his knowledge of
                divine things demanded of Him. Though therefore Hauoch &#40;Enoch and Noah&#44; of
                whom the Bible speaks in this way&#44; may not have been instructed to the <pb
                    n="46"/> 46 WALKING BEFORE GOD. same extent as we of the present day are
                &#40;but of this we have not sufficient knowledge to speak with any degree of
                certainty&#44; they were nevertheless acceptable&#44; because tliey were obedient
                according to the light permitted to them at tliat age of tlie world. The words &#34;
                walk before me&#34; then mean simply that man is&#44; so to say&#44; to walk on his
                way&#44; and constantly turn back to the Lord&#44; who is represented as being close
                behind him&#44; for advice how to pursue his jour&#8211; ney &#59; and &#34; after
                the Lord your God ye shall walk&#44; &#34; means that the Holy One is represented as
                leading the way carefully&#44; marking out every step&#44; before man takes it&#44;
                who is thus able to walk along securely&#44; without fear of going astray&#44; or to
                suffer any injury from concealed dangers which might beset liis path&#59; whereas
                the first phrase&#44; &#34; a man walked with God&#44; &#34; may mean that&#44;
                being as yet unused to divine knowl&#8211; edge&#44; not having yet many examples of
                holiness in others to direct him&#44; he required and obtained by his readiness to
                obey a constant and immediate divine aid to enable him to fulfil his duty. &#8212;
                This last there&#8211; fore is the expression applied to the early saints who&#44;
                as said&#44; had not yet a written law&#44; nor many holy ex&#8211; amples to guide
                them&#44; nor again a striking manifesta&#8211; tion of the divine displeasure
                against sinners&#44; such as the flood and the confusion of tongues were in
                subsequent times. Abraham&#44; however&#44; had already before him all these&#44;
                both the rewards and punish&#8211; ments&#44; the amount of traditionary precepts
                had also been enlarged &#59; lie was therefore able to pass along more securely than
                his predecessors&#44; and he had only to refer in any emergency to the God who was
                never far away to guide him when needed. Whereas the <pb n="47"/> WALKING BEFORE

                &#8212; So much simply in exposition of the variation in the phraseology in the
                words of Scripture&#44; which always should arrest our attention&#44; and which it
                is our business to elucidate&#44; if our information will per&#8211; mit us to do
                so. But let us return to our text&#58; Abraham&#44; the destined father of a great
                people&#44; in whom all the nations of the earth were to be blessed&#44; bore in his
                own life a strong prefiguration of the fate of his descendants. Like them&#44; he
                was a wanderer for a great portion of liis life&#44; an exile from his father&#39;s
                house&#59; like them&#44; ho was often put in fear of his neighbours&#44; and had to
                defend himself against their secret evil intentions&#59; like them&#44; he received
                a law for his guidance&#59; and&#44; like them&#44; too&#44; his faith was tried
                variously&#44; and on every occasion he was proved true&#44; and came out brighter
                from the fire at each time that his integrity Avas tested. The whole life of our
                people&#44; from our origin to our attaining the end of our task&#44; is one of
                vicissitude and progress&#59; and throughout there has been and is a strong
                manifestation of providential care and kindness&#59; and in the same measure was the
                    <pb n="48"/> 48 WALKING BEFORE GOD. career of our progenitor one of progress
                from the time he was first selected as the harbinger of a better generation&#44;
                till he was ready to sacrifice the child of his acre to the behest of his Master.
                The Israelites were told that they should be perfectfwith the Lord their God &#59;
                and equally so was Abraham ordered to deport himself in order to attain the object
                of his existence. And precisely this is the chief end of our being&#44; the crowning
                of the creation of man on earth&#59; every act which he does&#44; and every change
                he meets with&#44; have only for object that he may rise to a higher degree &#59;
                and hence does the royal preacher well say&#44; &#34; A good name is better than
                precious oil&#44; and the day of death better than the day of man&#39;s birth&#44;
                &#34; because he in act&#8211; ing righteously has acquired for himself enduring
                happiness&#44; and his spirit is placed in a higher perfec&#8211; tion than it was
                on the day he first saw the light of the world. The same wnll also be the case wath
                Is&#8211; rael. We stood high in the divine favour when we received the law at
                Sinai&#59; but higher far will we be esteemed when &#34; the ransomed of the Lord
                shall re&#8211; turn to Zion with song&#44; when everlasting joy shall be on their
                heads&#44; and when sorrow and sighing shall flee away.&#34; So this was to be the
                task of Abraham&#44; to become perfect &#59; and the means of his doing so were also
                in&#8211; dicated&#44; that is&#44; he was to walk before the Lord&#44; or&#44; as
                we have explained it&#44; he was constantly to turn to Him and his revelation for
                guidance&#44; and to do that only which he was certified to be pleasing in the eyes
                of the Lord. The reason was also given&#58; &#34;I am the Almighty God&#44; &#34;
                and herewith had Abraham pointed out to himself and his descendants the whole <pb

                demands of us to be active in his service &#59; it is not one of a brief period on
                earth who tells us to forego our pleas&#8211; ures in order to please him&#59; it is
                not one of limited power who bids to do that which is unpleasant to us&#44; and
                imposes a task on us by the potency of his to us irresistible power&#59; on the
                contrary&#44; it is the Eternal One who calls us to his service &#59; it is the
                Unending in days who tells us to listen to his instruction&#44; so that we may not
                follow blindly the impulses of our passions &#59; and it is at last the Most High
                whose power pervades all&#44; from whose all&#8211;seeing eye no one can escape&#44;
                who admonishes us to follow his guidance&#44; not because that we may mortify our
                will or undergo needless hardships&#44; but in order that we may become perfect
                through obedience. All this moreover is not to pass unheeded by Him and uselessly to
                us&#59; but He is the God Almighty&#44; therefore capable of sustaining us under all
                difficulties&#44; and to regulate all that oc&#8211; curs so that it may contribute
                to our ultimate advan&#8211; tage &#59; for rewards are with Him&#44; and He will
                recom&#8211; pense his servants to the utmost desire of their heart when the proper

                them enlargement&#44; and life from the midst of death. &#8212; Whatever
                sacrifice&#44; therefore&#44; we make in the service of the Lord has always this
                peculiar effect&#44; it subdues our desires and gives us the mastery of
                ourselves&#59; it brings down the tumultuous heaving of the rebellious heart to the
                control of reason&#44; and en&#8211; ables us to become more tranquil&#44; more
                resigned&#44; and more ready to be a blessing to all around us. In&#44; VOL. VIII. 6

                reverence the Father of men&#44; by yielding our impulses to his instruction &#59;
                since we obey because He commands&#44; and we yield our pre&#8211; possessions for

                means of the sword &#59; he was resigned to make every sacri&#8211; fice to the
                dictates of his religion&#44; not even sparing his own child&#44; when supposing

                pray that even the small number of ten righteous men might be permitted to screen
                the doomed cities from destruction. We are apt to call the days of our ancestor a
                dark age&#59; but if we may take his life as an evidence&#44; we should pronounce a
                high encomium on the elevated position which humanity had then attained. But
                again&#44; we must not take it for granted that all were equal&#44; or approached

                Israelites&#44; correspond with the bright example which was set us in the early
                ages of the world&#44; and let us not do aught which could cast a stigma on our name
                and character. Whatever sin towards God we are guilty of proves&#44; that we are not
                entire with Him&#44; that we do not follow Ilim on the path of faith which He bids
                us pursue. And whatever wrong we inflict on men also proves&#44; that we have not
                yet learned to suppress revenge&#44; and a love for gain&#44; and a desire for idle
                indulgence&#44; whilst it ought to be the study of every Israelite to love
                mercy&#44; to do justice&#44; and to walk humbly before his God. &#8212; Let us
                reflect how greatly Abraham&#39;s faith was tried. When he was about eighty years
                old&#44; he was told that from him should descend a nation holy to the service of
                God. Yet years passed on&#44; and he felt that the son of Ilagar was not the child
                through whom the blessing was to be accomplished. And now he was on the verge of a
                century&#44; when he was notifled that he was not yet perfect&#44; and that all his
                former acts of piety and humanity left yet something unaccomplished. He was told
                that God would make a covenant with him&#44; and cause him to become exceedingly
                numerous in his descendants&#59; but on the condition that he and all to spring from
                him should adopt the token of the outward covenant&#44; in the circumcision of all
                the males of his family to the latest generation. Abraham did not complain&#59; he
                did not inquire&#44; why at so late a period in his life only this painful command
                bad been imposed on him. It was enough for him that the <pb n="55"/> WALKING BEFORE
                GOD. 55 Lord commanded&#44; and he immediately obeyed&#44; and induced obedience in
                all his household&#44; as he had been ordered to do. He stood firm in his faith&#44;
                and obedience crowned the trust which he felt in his heart&#59; and he thus set us
                the example of uncomplain&#8211; ing&#8211; submission to the instruction of the
                Lord&#44; though we may not see the least reason for the precepts we have received.
                &#8212; that we all might be animated by the same docile spirit&#33; that we all
                might excel in wisdom&#44; and yet follow submissively the instruction which our
                religion gives us &#33; How happy would Israel be&#44; were one heart and one soul
                to dwell in them all to follow the guidance of the Lord&#44; and how speedily would
                we then attract&#44; by the brightness of our example&#44; the nations who yet walk
                in darkness. &#8212; Yet we are sin&#8211; ning&#44; and many of us disregard their
                Abrahamic birth&#8211; rio&#94;ht. and refuse to confess themselves his children
                through the token of the covenant. How grievous is such sin&#44; where a father cuts
                ofi&#39; his own olispring&#44; and induces him to have no name&#44; no
                inheritance&#44; no share in the sanctuary of the Lord&#59; and how small must be
                that faith&#44; which will hesitate in obedience in a matter of such weight and
                importance. But all ye who are faithful&#44; who have received the seal of the

                and Chaldeans&#44; and many other nations of antiquity&#44; or modern times. But we
                find that our fate was not such&#44; that we were not left to chance to seek our
                position in the scale of humanity&#59; but an observer of the course of events will
                discern without much labour a uniform thread running through our whole history&#44;
                and this is the religious element&#44; which more than any other people places us
                before the world as a separate and particular branch among the fami&#8211; lies of
                the earth. It is true that we are a peculiar race through our descent from a common
                parentage &#59; that our features and visage bear a marked contrast to those of
                other men&#44; so that the Jewish physiognomy <pb n="58"/> 58 THE EXAMPLE OF ISRAEL.
                is readily distinguishable in by flir the larger portion of our members&#59; but
                this does not&#44; for all that&#44; con&#8211; stitute the characteristic of the
                Jewish people&#44; and forms barely a mark of their descent from a stock deriving
                its origin from a distant and foreign land&#44; and is very often shared by nations
                living under an analogous climate to that which our fathers inhabited. Whatever
                physical characteristics may be ours&#44; how&#8211; ever&#44; could only have been
                preserved unchanged through a close union among ourselves&#44; and the ex&#8211;
                clusion of foreign admixture&#59; for it would have been impossible to maintain&#44;
                for instance&#44; the peculiar con&#8211; formation of features which generally
                denote the Jew&#44; if he had derived his descent from all sorts of nations&#59;
                since in this case he would naturally be tinctured by the peculiar marks of other
                races. But how could such a union be maintained&#63; You may answer. By an absolute
                prevention of all intermarriage with other nationalities. But it is very evident
                that&#44; however this raio&#8211;ht have been possible whilst we formed a state of
                our own in Palestine&#44; with political power and an independent civil
                government&#44; which might&#44; if it had thought ht&#44; denied the entrance of
                all for&#8211; eigners into the state&#44; as did the Chinese till lately&#44; and
                as do the people of Japan to this very day&#44; it would have been entirely
                impossible as soon as we had lost our nationality&#44; and became intimately mixed
                up with the people of nearly every state under the sun&#44; which did not disdain to
                receive our wanderers in its boundaries. Besides this consideration another one must
                present itself to our investigation&#59; it is this&#44; that strangers were not
                precluded from living in Pal&#8211; estine&#44; and what is more&#44; from being
                received as <pb n="59"/> THE EXAMPLE OF ISRAEL. 59 members of the state&#44; and
                even of families of Israel&#8211; ites&#59; there were restrictions and conditions
                under which citizenship in its fall extent&#44; and household membership&#44; could
                be obtained&#59; but they were by no means very difficult of attainment&#44; and the
                way to a union with Jews was left open to all who chose to become candidates for the
                same. Whoever then says that Jews have preserved themselves by their unso&#8211;
                ciable rejection of all foreign alliance&#44; assigns the effect instead of the
                cause for the mighty and wonder&#8211; ful moral phenomenon which they present in
                the records of history&#59; since the causes of their&#44; what many call&#44;
                unsocial habits have to be sought in the very principle to which they owe their
                being&#44; and this is&#44; as we have said already&#44; the religion which is
                theirs. We may freely assert that we are physically and mentally differently
                constituted from any other people&#59; we may say that we repel any approach to
                foreign alliance&#59; but we may safely deny that it is owing to a hatred of
                mankind&#44; which induces us not to forego voluntariiy our identity&#44; or that it
                is a wish to be singular which governs us in our seclusion. The reason however is
                only&#44; that we have received a religion as a heavenly deposit&#44; and which&#44;
                in our pre&#8211; serving it for us and our descendants&#44; as our fathers guarded
                it for themselves and us their successors&#44; necessarily compels us to exclude
                ourselves from a communion with strangers&#44; which could in any way endanger in
                our hands the possession of our ancestral faith and practice. Were it indeed
                that&#44; in the course of events&#44; a system had been evolved in all respects
                equal or superior to our own&#58; it would have been the height of folly to have

                from the rest of mankind&#44; at a time when we had neither national existence nor a
                country to call our own&#59; when our glory was all belonging to the past&#44; and
                our wished&#8211;for home was barely a deep&#8211;seated hope&#44; burning at times
                brightly&#44; at times faintly&#44; in our bosoms. What however is it that causes
                the Israelite&#44; even him who is reckless in religion&#44; and almost unthinking
                on his God&#44; to start back with hor&#8211; ror when contemplating the thought of
                being lost in his descendants to the household of Jacob &#63; It is the deeply
                impressed feeling that no law is true but that proclaimed at Sinai &#59; that there
                is no god&#44; beside Him who redeemed us from Egypt&#44; and no saviour save the
                One who has promised to show us mercy and goodness whenever we shall return to Him
                and seek his favour in sincerity&#44; in contrition&#44; and with humble prayer.
                Yes&#44; far may the Israelite go astray&#59; but it will embitter more than
                anything else his dying hour&#44; to reliect on the awful position he is in towards
                his God and his people&#44; when he knows that his chil&#8211; dren are cut off from
                the inheritance of the Lord&#44; that they are the un circumcised of flesh and
                heart&#44; and worship strange gods&#44; and kneel down at the stranger&#39;s
                shrine. Whence is this horror&#63; whence this deep&#8211;seated dread at a loss of
                an inheritance which has no worldly advantages to offer&#63; which only holds out to
                its possessor daj&#8211;s of watching&#44; and not rarely nights of anguish &#63; It
                is that every son of Jacob feels that he is&#44; of right and in truth&#44; an
                in&#8211; heritor of Divine favour in possessing a knowledge of the Unity of the
                Godhead&#44; which was announced in a multitude of visions&#44; and in the majesty

                with a pure system of morals and rules of worship&#44; than which nothing
                holier&#44; nothing purer&#44; nothing truer&#44; can be imagined by man&#44; like
                which nothing equalling it in holiness&#44; purity&#44; and truth&#44; was
                promulgated elsewhere to the children of the dust. Therefore it is that the
                Israelite fears losing his right in the universal God&#44; that he dreads being cut
                ofi&#39; from the inheritance in the blessings which are promised to our race&#44;
                should his children and their descendants&#44; in whom the ultimate hope of the

                nevertheless it has not ceased to be a distinct branch of the human family&#44;
                though there is no doubt that many strangers to our ancestry have by degrees been
                joined to us&#44; and learned to swear by the name of Him who dwells on high. And in
                all these trials many have fallen off from the parent branch&#59; they were either
                allured by the freedom of gentile manners&#44; the absence of the burden of the law
                wliich they saw in otbers&#44; or they were territied by the sorrows which they had
                to en&#8211; dure&#44; and sought for enlargement by denying their God and
                Saviour&#44; and Ibrswearing their allegiance to his laws. I called your attention
                on a previous oc&#8211; casion to the remarkable diminution to which we were
                subject&#44; first by the slaughter of millions at the destruction of the

                which it was endeavoured to exterminate us. I do not remind you of this to enkindle
                in your hearts a hatred of those not believing as we do&#59; but to impress on
                you&#44; in all sincerity&#44; that the world and its allurements offer no safety to
                Israel. You may be told that you are loved <pb n="63"/> THE EXAMPLE OF ISRAEL. 63

                in your custody&#59; but never beheve that&#44; for these benefits to mankind
                conferred by your religion&#44; our religion is loved by those who have not embraced
                it. The world and its followers look on you with a jealous eye&#44; and they would
                think no labour nor effort in vain&#44; which would induce you to surrender it&#44;
                and if you would but be persuaded to become like other men&#44; and be no longer
                distinctive sons of Israel. The very fires of persecution were kindled and
                blazed&#44; not&#44; as they said&#44; to punish our bodies&#44; but to fit our
                souls for heaven&#59; and though the stake is not now invoked to effect this
                end&#44; other means are not left untried to produce the same result. Ours is a
                constant state of warfare with all around &#59; and we must therefore be constantly
                watchful that the holy citadel which we are appointed to guard suf&#8211; fer no

                you are within the safe inclosure&#59; you can walk with security&#44; surrounded as

                well forgive the wrong done to you in the ignorance of&#8211; the proud and the

                been shed&#44; await in silence the coming events&#44; and your God will act for
                yOu&#44; and his thun&#8211; ders will not sleep when it is requisite for the
                benefit of all that they should be awakened&#44; and when his holy arm is to be

                your destiny&#44; and directs everything so that it may best contribute to your
                preservation&#44; the happi&#8211; ness of the world&#44; and the furtherance of his
                glory among mankind. You are his instruments&#59; you are but as the clay in the
                hands of the potter&#59; He moulds you to answer to his wise purposes&#59; wherefore
                you should never presume to rise up in rebellion against Him&#44; and ask Him&#44;

                very reverse of it&#44; however&#44; clearly proves&#44; that as yet you have not
                reached that state of perfection&#44; or that at least the world has not yet

                yet the struggle for truth has to be waged by you&#44; either actively or in a

                experience of past ages is worth the least consideration &#59; if the Bible iu any
                way is a proper guide for us to follow&#44; we ought to be ashamed at the littleness
                of our faith&#44; at the proneness to sin which we display on every occasion. It is
                indeed un&#8211; fortunate that we understand so little the teachings of the
                Scriptures&#44; or that we heed them so little when we do. ITot so can Israel be
                dignified &#59; not so can we attain our proper rank as the favourites of
                Heaven&#44; as the children of salvation. On the contrary&#44; we ought steadily to
                pursue the course Avhich our fathers followed&#44; and be neither swayed by success
                on the one side to forget our accountability&#44; nor be urged by untoward events to

                up with gratitude to Him who blesses the seasons &#59; and when evil betides us let
                us resort to prayer to lay our case before God&#44; and He will hear our cry and

                example of Jacob should herein teach us a les&#8211; son of wisdom and piety. He had
                by the intervention of Providence escaped the malevolence of his father&#8211;

                days&#44; of four hundred warlike men&#44; who followed him. Jacob did not
                devi&#8211; ate from his course to his paternal home&#44; and seek safety in
                flight&#59; because he had been told to return to the land of his birth&#44; and
                that the Lord would be with him. Nor did he rely on this promise as doing <pb n="68"

                errors and sins to which man is liable&#44; might have exposed him or a portion of
                his household to punish&#8211; ment&#44; through the instrumentality of Esau&#44;
                subse&#8211; quent to the time that the revelation concerning his homeward journey
                had been made known to him in his late residence. He therefore resorted to prayer as
                the only refuge for him&#44; and all other afflicted ones in the day of
                distress&#44; and called on the Lord to pro&#8211; tect him in that strait in which
                he was&#44; not for any merit in himself&#59; because he averred that he was
                un&#8211; worthy of all the mercies and the truths which had been bestowed on him
                &#59; since he passed the river Jor&#8211; dan&#44; in his flight from his
                father&#39;s house&#44; with a sim&#8211; ple staft&#39; for his possession&#44; and
                he had now returned with two troops of cattle&#44; in which at that time con&#8211;

                attendants&#44; and blessed with a hopeful progeny of twelve God&#8211;fearing
                children. And thus he con&#8211; cluded his prayer &#58; &#34; And Thou hast
                said&#44; I will surely do good with thoc&#44; and rendiT thy descendants like the

                wrath of the long&#8211;offended Esan &#59; since Jacob had top much cause to
                suppose that&#44; from his brother&#39;s impulsive nature&#44; he might inflict some
                grievous in&#8211; jury on those who had not injured him&#44; only because they were
                connected with himself by the tics of kin&#8211; dred. It is needless to
                recapitulate the story of the reconciliation of the brothers&#44; as it is more
                simply and beautifully told than any one except the sacred historian could do in so
                few words&#59; enough&#44; the prayer of Jacob was answered&#44; and he and his were
                spared to live and sanctify the Lord of hosts by their faith and their deeds.
                &#8212; And as was the life of Jacob&#44; 80 has been our existence as a nation.
                Exiled from the home of our fathers&#44; we have had to mingle with persons and
                nations holding beliefs differing from ours &#59; circumstances have constantly
                occurred to draw us away unto the path of sin&#44; and to forsake the Lord who had
                chosen us. Like Jacob&#44; too&#44; we have been surrounded with perils&#44; and
                many a time has the per&#8211; secutor&#39;s sword flashed brightly over our
                heads&#44; and in its descent it was made drunken with the blood of the Lord&#39;s
                saints&#44; of those who lived not for them&#8211; selves&#44; but for the happiness
                of mankind. And even when the storm blew loudest&#44; when the waves rose to the
                most overwhelming height&#44; was the voice of Is&#8211; rael heard invoking the
                Lord of hosts to remember the covenant and the oath&#44; which had secured to the
                ancients the protection of the Supreme Arm&#44; against which all human eflbrts were
                in vain. And though&#44; notwithstanding our prayers&#44; many perished&#44; the

                the more freely&#44; and that its shadow became more enlarged&#44; so that many more
                could refresh themselves by its fruits&#44; and be sheltered under its
                wide&#8211;spreading branches. And it flourishes and lives&#59; and though new
                insects have sprang up to injure its growth and beauty&#44; they will perish
                also&#44; but the tree itself will live&#44; and become again renewed after the
                present danger. For it is this over which the Lord watches &#59; it is this for
                which He has appointed us its guardians and keepers. But let us not fail in being
                faithful&#44; and we too shall each be blessed by the Lord of our labours&#44; and
                He will give us a portion and a name in his sanctuary&#44; a name of glory which
                shall not be cut off&#34;&#44; and a reward of life which shall never cease. Amen.

                &#33; It is not the length of time which we have lived on earth which makes our life

                appeal to common sense to give us an answer to the highly important inquiry&#44;

                our investigation to a subject which can only give us some pain. But the awakening

                the result of exertions&#59; sunshine must give way to clouds and storms &#58; it is

                poignancy. No&#44; all nature oti&#39;ers joy to man &#59; therefore it is no sin to

                things to be deprecated &#59; on the contrary&#44; it is the will of Providence&#44;

                whom the departing sufferers feel so much solicitude&#59; but that He will sustain
                them&#44; provided only they deserve his favour&#44; as He did unto the Israelites
                in the desert&#44; and as He fed Elijah at the brook of Chebar during the season of
                famine&#44; and as He guided our father Jacob during his long sojourn in the service
                of Laban. Now to have such a hopeful state of mind there is no need <pb n="76"/> 76

                conscious&#8211; ness of having spent a life of pleasure&#59; but a simple feeling
                of dependence on God&#44; on his love and his bounty&#44; und a consciousness of
                having discharged in all possible wayS whatever of duty came in our prov ince to
                execute&#44; thereby proving that we duly appre&#8211; ciated our obligation to the
                Giver of life and our rela&#8211; tive position to our fellow&#8211;mortals. I
                combine both points to complete the assurance of perfect peace&#59; for no man has a
                right to say that he has completed his task by a mere exercise of philanthropy from
                his superabundant stores&#44; when he parted with that which he needed not&#44; and
                which perhaps he did not miss in giving it away&#44; whilst he heeded not the
                demands of his religion&#44; which counsel him to use his means only in the manner
                indicated in the law. In the same way&#44; can he not lay himself down without fear
                of retribution&#44; who spent his life in the observance of ceremony and
                devotion&#44; and forgot that there are human beings around him who have a right to
                ex&#8211; pect from him charity and fair&#8211;dealing&#44; according to their
                respective relations to him. Man&#44; on the con&#8211; trary&#44; should be what
                religion desires him to be&#44; per&#8211; fect with his God&#44; perfect with
                God&#39;s creatures&#59; and only then&#44; when he has well fulfilled his
                obligations&#44; can he approach the termination of his days with calm
                tranquillity&#44; and look undismayed on the ap&#8211; proach of death&#44; which is
                then to him not merely the dark gulf which he must pass&#44; the termination of
                which is involved in the deep mazes of eternity&#44; but he beholds it as a fearful
                chaimel&#44; at the brink of which the light of his God beams to his awakened
                vision&#44; and he espies in the distance bright sunlit fields <pb n="77"/>

                inexhaustible pleasures&#44; whilst towards him come legions of holy ones to conduct
                him to the Presence where all is glory&#44; where all is peace &#59; he feels that
                he steps from a state of pain into one where pain is not felt&#44; and from a state
                of sorrow to one where tears are not&#59; because the Lord God has there destroyed
                death to everlasting&#44; and removed the shame of those who are truly his people
                through the obedient service which they have rendered Him&#44; and He has wiped away
                the tears from every face&#44; in a life where He is ever present&#44; in an
                existence where He is in truth all in all to those who behold his delights and dwell
                for&#8211; ever in his palace. It is not indeed the happiness of every good man to
                die with such a perfect calm&#44; with such a complete assurance of a blissful
                future revealed before his opened vision. But the Bible furnishes us with sev&#8211;
                eral happy illustrations&#44; and among others we have the example of Israel&#44;
                who in his last moments proved himself to be at peace with God and all the world. I
                say not that the Bible asserts that Jacob had not sinned during any part of his
                existence&#59; for this is not in consonance with history&#44; nor can we assert it
                as a doctrine of religion that a life must be entirely free from sin to insure the
                mercy of God. No&#44; this is not the doctrine of the Bible&#59; it teaches&#44; on
                the contrary&#44; that man is liable to transgress through the conformation of his
                human constitution&#44; being a com&#8211; pound of spirit and matter&#59; but that
                God in his mercy will punish the righteous on earth&#44; and then forgive the guilt
                atoned for through repentance and con&#8211; trition. Now let us review Jacob&#39;s
                life as it is given 1&#42; <pb n="78"/> 78 Jacob&#39;s death. to us &#59; let us put
                tlie greatest weight on his misdeeds as we find them recorded&#44; and let us esteem
                ever so lightly his sufferings and sorrows&#58; still the most scrupulous claimant
                of retributive justice must ac&#8211; knowledge that our ancestor amply atoned for
                all the wrong he ever did&#44; by the years of agony he had to endure. Regard him as
                a fugitive from his father&#39;s house for a period of twenty&#8211;two years on
                account of the blessing he had surreptitiously&#8211; obtained&#44; it being
                destined for his brother &#59; and again contemplate him enduring an awful state of
                suspense for another twenty&#8211;two years whilst Joseph was absent&#44; torn away
                by his brothers&#39; violence&#44; and sold into slavery&#44; not to enumerate the
                other trials which Jacob was forced to encounter&#58; and the most patient of men
                would be compelled to pray that the Lord might spare him such fearful
                visitations&#44; for such small transgressions as we find recorded against this
                eminent individual. We must on the contrary maintain that in no instance were
                sufferings so well calculated to elevate to a hiarh degree the one against whom they
                were sent&#59; he was in his youth perfect and upright&#59; and the sins of later
                years were wiped awa&#94;&#39; through the merciful dispensa&#8211; tions which a
                wise Judge inflicted to purify&#44; and to lift up the progenitor of the people with
                whom He&#44; the Father of mankind&#44; contemplated to establish an ever&#8211;
                lasting covenant. We have&#44; therefore&#44; these doctrines evolved from the
                history of Jacob&#58; firsts that no man is secured against the approach of sin
                &#59; secondly&#44; that a man is not absolutely rejected because he has
                trans&#8211; gressed &#59; thirdbj&#44; that ho can repent and become re&#8211;

                transgressor through commensurate punishment&#59; and Jifthlii&#44; that punishments
                tlms viewed are not an evi&#8211; dence of rejection from the grace and mercy of the
                Most High. We must pass over the practical appU&#8211; cation of these
                doctrines&#44; as they embrace a subject of inquiry of sufficient importance to be
                taken by itself alone&#59; but this much we may assert at once&#44; that they are in
                perfect accordance with our ideas of salvation through the mercy and grace of the
                Creator alone&#44; without the intervention of a mediator or sec&#8211; ondary power
                to screen us against impending wrath&#44; and that any doctrine militating against
                this view is both opposed to reason and Scripture. So behold&#44; then&#44; our
                father Israel stretched on the bed from which he was assured he should never rise
                again in fliis life&#59; and what do you see&#63; Does he lament and mourn that his
                death approaches&#63; does he repine over the hardships he had been compelled to
                endure&#44; though he had frequent communications from God&#44; such as no other man
                had received before him&#63; or do you find him recounting his own good deeds&#44;
                and boasting of what he had done as a man of religion or philanthropy &#63; Nothing
                of all this&#44; he is tranquil&#44; he is resigned&#44; he awaits the coming
                disso&#8211; lution&#44; whilst he prepares himself to give his last charge to his
                children&#44; the future fathers of the God&#8211; chosen people&#44; who are again
                all united&#44; and all stand&#8211; ing around the couch of sufiering of their
                glorious progenitor. You must understand well that Jacob&#39;s knowledge was not
                that of an ordinary man&#59; he was permitted to look far into the arcana of coming
                events&#44; and that which is to happen to his latest descendants was made clear to
                his ken. It was then in this temper <pb n="80"/> 80 Jacob&#39;s death. of mind that
                he spoke his last words&#44; some of which are not perhaps as clear to us as the
                accomplishment of them will render them at last &#59; they are merely short and
                sententious&#44; couched in the most elevated and figurative language of poetry&#44;
                doubtless taking their peculiar form from customs and ideas prevailing at that
                time&#44; the knowledge of which has not come down to us&#44; or those even from
                whom we have re&#8211; ceived our immediate mstr action. But this much we do
                know&#44; that he clearly indicated the peculiar rela&#8211; tive position of the
                brothers in their future connexion with each other&#44; and in their possessions
                which they respectively acquired in the land of promise. This history proves beyond
                contradiction&#44; and it shows us therefore that&#44; in his last moments&#44;
                Jacob&#39;s mind still retained the inspiration of God and the certainty of the
                truth&#44; which so long accompanied him during his weary pilgrimage&#44; the days
                of his sojourning as he called them in his interview with Pharaoh. What&#8211;
                ever&#44; therefore&#44; he said must be viewed not as a mat&#8211; ter of
                speculation but of certainty&#44; if we are only acquainted with the import of the
                words employed&#44; and we are therefore authorized to base on the bless&#8211; ings
                of Jacob doctrines which arc to be our guide for life. It would take a wide range to
                go over the whole of them &#59; we must therefore be satisfied for the pres&#8211;
                ent with the illustrations of a single phrase&#44; connected as it is with the
                subject with which we commenced this day. I refer to the apparently isolated
                exclama&#8211; tion with which concludes the blessing addressed to Dan&#44; and
                which consists of but three words in the original&#44; namely &#58; <pb n="81"/>
                Jacob&#39;s death. 81 &#34;For thy salvation do I hope&#44; O Lord&#33;&#34; Genesis
                xlix. 18. As it is quite nncounected with the preceding verses&#44; we may assume
                that it is either a general blessing addressed to all the sons&#44; or perhaps that
                it was an exclamation of Israel&#44; forced from him at the moment of acute
                suffering preceding so immediately his dissolution. Still&#44; whatever be the
                meaning of the phrase in the relative position which it had to the dying
                patriarch&#44; its value is not diminished in a doc&#8211; trinal point of view
                &#59; for it embraces the assertion that all salvation proceeds from the one
                Source&#44; from the only one God&#44; whom Jacob had learned to wor&#8211; ship in
                the multitude of prophetic visions which had been vouchsafed to him. Whether&#44;
                therefore&#44; it is addressed to one or all the fathers of the tribes&#44; or
                whether it is a brief prayer spoken by Israel for his own behalf&#44; it teaches us
                that&#44; Avhether in life or in death&#44; there is but one means of salvation&#44;
                but one point to which our eyes should be directed. Faith in the power of God&#44; a
                trust in his salvation was the last thought of the man Israel&#44; he who had next
                to Moses and Abraham been the fiimiliar in God&#39;s house&#59; and as he
                departed&#44; so let us depart this life. Was it only necessary for him to place his
                trust on the mercy which is flowing from the perennial Fountain&#44; without
                in&#8211; voking sacrifice or mediation &#58; so must it be suflicient for ns to
                lean on the same mighty God for support&#44; in order to carry us through the gates
                of death&#44; to look for his salvation in the future life whither we are
                journeying. I know well enough that Israelites are faithful&#44; that they are
                sincere believers in the only <pb n="82"/> 82 Jacob&#39;s death. true God&#59;
                nevertheless it is well to impress on their minds that our doctrines are those
                taught by the holy Scriptures&#44; that we have not permitted fallible men to fasten
                on us views of their own not countenanced by the evident word of God. Besides&#44;
                it is often our duty to give to others&#44; differing from us&#44; satisfactory
                reasons for our faith &#59; it is therefore proper that we should hold up to those
                who have yet to learn what we have received as a legacy from Heaven&#44; and to
                impress on their minds a few strong arguments&#44; if nothing more&#44; which may
                stand them in good stead to ward off specious appeals which are constantly ad&#8211;
                dressed to them by strangers to shake their >constancy. If&#44; then&#44; you are
                asked to join in the manner of those who lean on a broken reed for support&#44; who
                invoke the aid of one whom they imagine capable of plead&#8211; ing for them before
                the great Father &#58; tell them that you tread in the footsteps of those blessed
                lights of the earth who shone in imperishable brightness long before the founder of
                their errors was born&#44; ages be&#8211; fore their corrupt views of religion were
                in existence&#59; and as these saints prayed&#44; so will you pray&#59; as they
                believed&#44; so will you believe&#59; as they lived&#44; so will you live&#59; and
                as they died&#44; so will you die. It may appear bold in a sinful mortal&#44; even
                after having made his peace with man&#44; and atoned&#44; as far as he can&#44; for
                the sins which he committed against the Su&#8211; preme&#44; to appeal directly to
                God for forgiveness&#44; for mercy&#44; and to receive his spirit in favo.ur. But it
                is not human reason which has taught us to do so&#59; for&#44; on the contrary&#44;
                it is the word of the living God itself which impresses us by precept and example to
                speak directly to Him in the hour of our need &#59; to lay open <pb n="83"/>
                Jacob&#39;s death. 83 to Him our wounded heart&#44; to confide into his hand our
                broken spirit&#44; &#34;because&#44; &#34; as the Psahiiist ex&#8211; presses
                himself&#44; &#34; He the God of truth will redeem us.&#34; So also spoke Jacob in
                the text we have chosen &#58; &#34; In thy salvation do I hope&#44; O Lord
                &#33;&#34; It is this en&#8211; tire confidence in God&#44; his word&#44; his
                truth&#44; which should distinguish the Israelite above all other men &#59; it
                should prove that he has been worthily trained for heaven&#59; that he has truly
                confided in the doctrines which have been impressed on his mind from early infancy
                till mature old age. And if this be so&#44; then can he look undismayed on the
                future&#44; even as did Jacob&#44; and see his end approach&#59; then can he
                com&#8211; mand his children&#44; as did the patriarch&#44; and exhort them to walk
                in the way of the Lord&#59; and then can he gather his feet into his bed and expire
                calmly&#44; in the assurance of an awakening in a better life under the shadow of
                the wings of the Almighty&#44; protected against evil&#44; and secure in peace and
                happiness. And such a death is worth a life of virtue and resis&#94;nation to
                God&#39;s decrees&#59; it is the crowning triumph of those who have done the will of
                their Maker&#59; and let it then come to them in their early years&#44; or when they
                are full of days and honour&#44; it matters not&#59; for their earthly life has been
                long enough to earn for them salvation and a blissful recompense&#59; and the good
                they hoped for will be theirs&#44; and their memorial will be accepted&#44; and
                their name will be a blessing&#44; even as was that of the ancient servant of God
                after whom the sons of Israel are called. And let us hope that such may be our own
                lot&#59; that we may live in har&#8211; mony with God&#44; and in concord with his

                &#33; It is now twenty&#8211;four years ago since this structure was opened&#44;
                after being rebuilt from the foundation&#44; and dedicated anew to the worship of
                the God of Jacob. The hymn then pealed for the first time in this house&#44; and the
                unity of God was proclaimed as the watchword of the congregation assembled within
                these walls&#44; and they declared themselves thereby to be members and confederates
                of the family of Israel. Of the many who then filled the seats a large propor&#8211;
                tion have silently sunk into the grave&#44; and their voice is heard no more in our
                assembly. But the same spirit which induced them to labour in erecting this
                house&#44; which filled them with joy when they saw it completed&#44; still dwells
                among us&#44; and we are here to declare again on this anniversary&#44; as on
                previous simi&#8211; lar occasions&#44; that we are of the same brotherhood of faith
                and hope&#44; as were thof&#63;e who erected this house and left it as a legacy to
                their successors. Mighty VOL. VIII. 8 <pb n="86"/> 86 THE STRENGTH OF OUR RELIGION.
                changes have since then passed over the earth &#59; em&#8211; pires have been
                overthrown &#59; new opinions in rehg&#8211; ion and politics have made themselves
                deeply felt&#59; thrones supposed to be immovably fixed have been moved and hurled
                to the ground &#59; science has achieved new triumphs in the field of discovery and

                young men &#59; and nevertheless with us the change has been light&#44; and has not
                cast the decay of age over our religion&#44; and we follow the path which our
                fathers followed&#44; and are again here to call on the name of the Most High&#44;
                and to speak of his deeds which He wrought in Egypt&#44; and of the signs which He
                displayed among them&#44; and we still emphatically feel that He is in truth the
                Lord Eternal&#44; to whom alone we are to direct our prayers&#44; whose law alone we
                are to consult as our rule of life. It is indeed but a short time&#44; comparatively
                speaking&#44; since the con&#8211; secration of this synagogue&#59; many of you well

                from many a tongue joining in praise to the Father of his people &#58; yet in the
                age of the world it has been a period of unusual activity&#44; and events have
                crowded each other as they rarely do even in the most turbulent times&#44; and
                infant ideas have since acquired a giant form&#44; and have filled the earth with

                the gradual develop&#8211; ment of the latent mighty thought of popular power&#44;
                will find nothing very remarkable in the event which was clearly stepping hourly
                more and more forward&#44; produced as it was by the effervescence of mind which had
                long since commenced&#44; and to arrest which noth&#8211; ing was capable which was
                at all within the power of the civil and religious government of the earth&#44;
                Ju&#8211; daism has been assailed likewise amidst all this din and clamour&#59; many
                predicted that the development of new thoughts would prove fatal to its isolation
                and to the hold it hitherto had on the mind of its follow&#8211; ers &#59; many also
                have united their exertions to pro&#8211; duce a mighty eflbrt to withdraw our
                members from a union with us&#44; and to offer them all sorts of induce&#8211; ments
                to surrender their adherence to our faith&#59; many&#44; farther&#44; have arisen
                among ourselves to diffuse strange notions&#44; and to establish views not formerly
                received among us&#44; and have alleged that new meas&#8211; ures must be supported
                to save a wreck of Jewish principles&#44; and to maintain a remnant of Israel&#39;s

                tion of our people. Those who only look at the sur&#8211; face may fancy that they
                see symptoms of decay &#59; because they aver that the changes from oppression to
                liberty will induce many to yield quietly that re&#8211; ligion&#44; which they
                convulsively clasped to their bosom in times when mankind endeavoured to deprive
                them of it by force&#59; that the more enlarged intercourse with the world will
                cause a gradual fusion of our na&#8211; tionality amidst the people where we
                reside&#44; by our taking in marriage those differing from us in ancestry and
                belief&#44; by which means our descendants will be mingled up with others and be no
                longer distinguish&#8211; able&#59; that the progress of ideas will sweep away the
                mutual prejudices entertained by Jews and gentiles&#44; and that the former will
                tlicn insensibly drop their peculiarities when the line of separation is reduced to
                an almost inappreciable thread. These may be the opinions of indifferent
                investigators&#44; when looking with surprise at the magnificent panorama of mighty
                events which are developing themselves daily before their eyes&#59; but if so&#44;
                they have not well understood the peculiarity of the Jews&#44; nor the
                characteristics of the gentile world. Great as are modern events&#44; they are not
                altogether unprecedented &#59; there have been before this times of quiet and
                eidargement for our people&#44; although they lasted but a brief space&#59; and we
                have yet to learn that the ease of the present will <pb n="89"/> THE STRENGTH OF OUR
                RELIGION. 89 endure much longer. But even if it should&#44; that does not say that
                the Jew will for this reason not value his characteristic mission any farther&#44;
                and yield his religion to the common demand for equality and fra&#8211; ternity&#44;
                as though this sacrifice were necessary in the new acquisition of liberty. People
                forget&#44; perhaps&#44; that religion has no part to play in the mighty and
                terrible dramas which have of late&#42; been enacted &#59; at least it has no
                business to interfere actively and visi&#8211; bly in public aft&#39;airs. Modern
                nations have so long con&#8211; stituted the profession of certain religious dogmas
                the arbitrary standard of political power&#44; and have made all sorts of privileges
                dependent on the profession of opinions sanctioned by the state&#44; that they
                cannot yet see that&#44; when they emancipate themselves from this odious
                tyranny&#44; the sufferers from the long ages of exclusion have nothing to yield
                when invited to par&#8211; take now of human rights. If it be necessary for us to
                reject any part of our religious views&#44; not to men&#8211; tion the totality of
                our faith&#44; to be entitled to political equality in all things&#58; what&#44; I
                ask&#44; have we gained by the change over which we rejoice &#63; Tyrants of
                an&#8211; cient days&#44; from Nebuchadnezzar down&#44; asked of us only that we
                should fall prostrate and worship the idol which they had erected &#59; it was only
                what they called doing a harmless thing which they required&#59; we should only
                become like them&#44; and then we might have life&#44; wealth&#44; power&#44;
                pleasure&#44; or whatever we might desire&#44; even the privilege of persecuting our
                former brothers of Israel. And now shall it be re&#8211; quired of us to

                coming of the son of David&#44; because this belief militates against the idea of a
                perfection in human wisdom&#44; &#8212; against the assumption that mere human
                reason can establish the kingdom of peace&#44; and secure in the best manner the sum
                total of hu&#8211; man happiness&#63; If this be so&#44; then there is no per&#8211;
                ceptible dilference between the tyranny of kings and democracies&#44; or between the
                intolerance of inquisitors and philosophical dreamers. If our religion must be
                destroyed&#44; it cannot make the least difference to the Jew who rules&#44; and
                what opinions obtain the su&#8211; premacy&#59; and for that matter&#44; we might
                prefer one tyrant at a time to the legions of opponents under the present system
                &#59; for we might ascertain the opinions required of us if a few or one would be
                able to dictate&#44; but it is impossible so to frame our ideas as to satisfy the
                vast masses which now rule. But it is freedom which is professed for all &#59; and
                we too enter into the new state of things&#44; not because we are Jews&#44; but
                because we are men &#59; and because&#44; while we have no right to question any
                human being concerning his religion or politics&#44; and while we do not ask of him
                to modify his opinions to please us&#44; we cannot permit any one to concern himself
                with what we believe or do in a religious relation&#44; which we have not and
                can&#8211; not surrender to the popular supervision&#44; it being the sacred right
                of consciciuce&#44; over which we alone have to watcli&#44; and the regulation of
                which must be left to tlie law and the customs of Israel&#44; as expounded to us by
                our religious teachers. Now&#44; it is possible enough&#44; nay&#44; it is well
                known to be 80&#44; that many will prove their worthiness of political liberty by
                making all sorts of concessions&#44; <pb n="91"/> THE STRENGTH OF OUR RELIGION. 91
                and by explaining away all the features of our belief which appear perhaps somewhat
                harsh to non&#8211;Israel&#8211; ites. But this is likewise certain&#44; that it
                will be chiefly in the first commencement of our new participation in political
                privileges&#59; but that&#44; when the thing has become somewhat old by habitual
                use&#44; the rightly&#8211; thinking portion of Jews will revert to the instruction
                of Scripture&#44; and profess anew what is taught there&#44; to the exclusion of all
                new philosophical speculations. It is also true that prosperity is a severe trial to
                our people. Persecutions they can face with indomitable courage &#59; they are a
                brave race&#44; and for endurance and persistency they are unequalled among mankind.
                In Egypt&#44; in Babylon&#44; in Persia&#44; and in Rome&#44; they remained
                distinguishable and united among the hea&#8211; thens&#59; and when the Nazarenes
                and Mahomedans arose successively with new and modified doctrines&#44; some few in
                comparison to their numbers were se&#8211; duced away from their allegiance&#44; but
                the vast majority&#8211; either perished nobly upholding their faith&#44; or lived
                through poverty&#44; contumely&#44; abhorrence&#44; and dis&#8211; grace&#44; and
                worshipped their God in humility and the want of every earthly comfort. And
                when&#44; from time to time&#44; the hand of persecution relaxed its tor&#8211;
                tures&#44; and when Jews were found the companions of the kings and the nobles&#44;
                the trusted servants of the crown&#44; or the confidential physicians of pontiffs
                and priests&#44; they&#44; frjr this sake&#44; did not&#44; as a class&#44; prove
                false to their opinions. Again&#44; I say&#44; that some could not bear this
                prosperity&#44; as others succumbed before and since to the terrors which surrounded
                them&#59; but they have proved the exceptions&#44; and hence their ex&#8211; ample
                need not influence us with the fear for the <pb n="92"/> 92 THE STRENGTH OF OUR

                But let me call your attention&#44; brethren&#44; to one re&#8211; markable
                circumstance&#44; and this is the inveterate hatred which has been always felt for
                tlie religion of Israel from the earliest history of our people. It was the same in
                Pharaoh who knew not the Lord&#44; the same in Balak&#44; king of Moab&#44; who
                misled Israel to sin&#44; the same in the bloody tribunals of the middle ages&#44;
                and again the same in the societies for the se&#8211; duction of the Jews from their
                faith&#44; of which we have heard so much of late years. Pharaoh&#44; Balak&#44; the
                Inquisition&#44; did&#44; in a measure&#44; succeed in their various ways to work
                mischief to us&#44; and many of us fell at the different epochs in which the above
                flour&#8211; ished in their schemes of wickedness. Should&#44; there&#8211;
                fore&#44; our enemies of the present age meet with some little success&#44; and
                obtain occasionally a lukewarm sin&#8211; ner or a hireling renegade to join himself
                to them&#58; we may be assured&#44; nevertheless&#44; of one thing&#44; that we have
                lost no strength by this severance from us of an unworthy member &#59; he has gone
                to those who will overwhelm him with kindness and embraces&#44; whilst we are rid of
                a traitor&#44; one false to God&#44; false to his brothers&#44; and false to himself
                Admit&#44; even&#44; that his conversion should be sincere&#44; so much so as to be
                above suspicion &#58; then we have lost one who could not defend his ancestral
                religion&#44; who had no heart for the law of Moses&#44; who understood not the
                glorious principle of the Unity of God&#44; that glorious principle wiiich will
                ultimately prevail from one end of the world to the other&#44; as it is solely the

                clown to the minutest dust which flits in the sunlight&#44; there is discoverable
                one uniform gradation&#44; a single and uniform design. Now it is the repugnance of
                many to the principle of the Unity&#44; as professed by us&#44; which is the key to
                all the efforts made for our extermination&#44; and to the hope constantly expressed
                that at last the means have been discovered of effecting it. So whilst there
                are&#44; I am glad to acknowledge&#44; thousands on thousands who wish to make us
                free on principles of humanity and justice&#44; there are&#44; perhaps&#44; as many
                others who acquiesce in the movement solely from an inimical feeling to Judaism.
                They have seen from history and experience&#44; that persecution and exclusion only
                riveted the closer the bonds which unite us to God &#58; so they then deem it a duty
                to try the opposite ex&#8211; treme&#44; and to see whether or not a perfect
                equaliza&#8211; tion of Jews and gentiles will not induce us to forego our
                identity&#44; and become like them. It is with us as it was with Samson. We&#44;
                like him&#44; are asked &#58; &#34; In what does your great strength
                consist&#63;&#34; But it is not&#44; like him&#44; an outward token&#44; but the
                inward spirit which constitutes us Jews&#59; yet like Samson&#39;s personal
                prowess&#44; it depends upon the will of God&#44; and on the condition that we
                follow the orders which we have received. We must not&#44; therefore&#44; fall
                asleep on the lap of a false Delilah&#44; of a gentile invitation to yield ourselves
                captives to the charms of the world&#44; as though a new era had commenced&#44; and

                at occasionally hearing of a defection from our ranks. It is deplorable&#44; deeply
                to be regretted&#44; that an Israelite&#44; the humblest of his tribe&#44; should be
                false to his faith &#59; but we should regard any apostacy arising from the present
                state of freedom&#44; even if perpetrated by the greatest and most influential&#44;
                as nothing fatal or particularly remark&#8211; able&#59; since&#44; at all
                times&#44; there have been. sinners and transgressors&#44; and for all that the lamp
                of Israel has not been quenched. The Scriptures&#44; brethren&#44; are a true record
                of the past and the future. Other writings may give a faith&#8211; ful narrative of
                the occurrences which have taken place&#59; we will assume that human information
                may be able to grapple with facts&#44; though even this is somewhat doubtful&#44; to
                judge from the ill success which historical investigations have so often met with.
                But the recesses of the future are absolutely locked up&#44; and inaccessible to
                human ken. Not so to the eye of God &#59; for this pervades all which will be&#44;
                and there is no uncertainty to shroud from Him the events which are coming. Nay&#44;
                they have come already&#44; so soon as He announces them &#59; because there can

                Judaism&#44; in its peculiar pre&#8211; cepts&#44; has received the stamp of
                eternity from the Author of our being&#44; and hence it is proved inde&#8211;
                structible in the wisdom of Providence. You have been told before&#44; but it cannot
                be too often repeated&#44; that the phraseology of the Bible is not one of accident
                but of design. Its omissions are of importance as much as what it contains &#59; and
                its precepts are of that character that they have to be so understood as the words
                in which they are given convey them to us&#44; not as arbitrary reasoning would
                perhaps wish to make them. If&#44; then&#44; it is said in the Bible that we shall
                do so&#44; but not otherwise&#44; we must implicitly fol&#8211; low the
                commandment&#44; and not reason it away by any fancy of our own&#44; however
                ingenious it may be. Nor must we be deterred by the assertion of others&#44; that it
                is not necessary for us so to act&#44; &#44; as to place a bar of separation between
                us and the world&#59; since the law&#44; in obedience to which we allege to act&#44;
                could not have meant it so particularly as we deem it to be. But this much we may
                safely allege&#44; that as the law is both imperative and prophetic&#44; both
                relating to conduct and indicating futurity&#44; it teaches this im&#8211; portant
                principle&#44; that its precepts are infallible and not to be repealed&#44; and
                that&#44; at the same time&#44; they will be always obeyed by the true descendants

                the religion of their fathers during all the changes and vicissitudes which have
                been&#44; and are&#44; impending over us. With this preface let us briefly elucidate

                And you shall observe this thing&#44; as a statute unto thee and unto thy children

                through the threatened slaughter of the flrst&#8211;born. Freedom was not yet
                theirs&#44; it was only in anticipa&#8211; tion. The task&#8211;masters were subdued
                to some extent by the terrible plagues which had been inflicted on them. They
                were&#44; nevertheless&#44; still powerful to hold in bondage their slaves who had
                served them well for nearly two hundred years&#59; and had the deliverance not taken
                place&#44; as promised&#44; it would have been utterly impossible for the Israelites
                to have observed the Passover&#44; of which institution the precept in ques&#8211;
                tion speaks&#44; neither then nor to perpetuity&#44; as is here enjoined. But what
                was the result at the time &#63; The deliverance did take place at the precise hour
                and in the manner indicated&#59; and ever since the Passover has been observed&#44;
                both as a national mark of thanksgiving to our great Deliverer&#44; and as a token
                that we accept Him as our Sovereign and God&#44; and acknowledge no one besides Him
                as having power in heaven and on earth. Our encounters with adversity of all kinds
                have been fearful enough to try the strength of our attachment to our Father&#59;
                and notwithstand&#8211; ing our frequent backslidings&#44; we have not altogether

                went out of Egypt&#44; adopted the new system thus intro&#8211; duced on earth&#44;
                and threatened us with all the ter&#8211; rors which fiendish malice could
                devise&#59; and when a bloody conqueror arose in the plains of Arabia&#44; and
                announced himself as a prophet of a new message in the name of the Most High&#44;
                and waged fierce war&#8211; fare against those who refused to acknowledge him and
                his mission &#59; and when other inventions of men were otfered to us&#44; to forego
                our testimony to the truth of God&#39;s Unity &#58; we stood firm&#44; if not
                unshaken&#59; and every spring&#8211;season&#44; in its annual return&#44; saw us
                celebrating the Lord&#39;s Passover&#44; even as we were commanded. And what
                mattered it to us how few there were left who could thus glorify the Lord &#63; Each
                man felt himself the representative of the Pa&#8211; triarchs&#44; and each woman
                knew that she bore in her&#8211; self a lineal descent from the mothers of
                Israel&#44; those noble matrons who stood side by side with their glo&#8211; rious
                spouses to proclaim the power of the Creator in periods when darkness overspread the
                earth&#44; and when the light of truth flickered at times like an ex&#8211; piring
                lamp&#44; being fed only by the efibrts of a single family. This has been our course
                for a very long period&#59; and the faith which was so firmly rooted&#44; so
                beautifully upheld&#44; has not been left unfruitful in its ef&#8211; fects&#44; and
                at this day the followers of the God of Jacob are more numerous than they have been
                probably since the destruction of the temple. They have increased even in the same

                would make an end of them. And thus have we been brought to the present period in
                our history&#59; for though yet persecuted in many coun&#8211; tries&#44; we have
                obtained freedom in many others&#44; and the secular sciences are open for our
                competition with other men. The period of transition is already nearly past &#59;
                and though severe blows have been struck by the ungodly against our union&#44; and
                though some have endeavoured to produce sectarian divis&#8211; ions among us&#44;
                still we may freely say that no success has attended these unholy etibrts. The
                newness of freedom may&#44; perhaps&#44; have inspired some of these movements&#59;
                but we are daily getting more used to it &#59; and before long we shall look
                round&#44; examine our position&#44; and fall back upon the word of God alone as our
                standard&#44; and reply to all opponents&#44; in the language of Scripture&#44; that
                our law&#44; with all its peculiarities&#44; was given to us and our descendants
                for&#8211; ever. The time of its duration is indefinite&#59; and as no probable
                period has been fixed&#44; we cannot listen to any appeals which counsel us to adopt
                any system which dispenses us of the observation of the pre&#8211; cepts. Only be ye
                all of good courage and unwaver&#8211; ing in your love for the law of God &#59; be

                depended the salva&#8211; tion of Israel&#44; and the permanence of the religion of

                We occasionally hear the strict Jew upbraided with being a formalist&#44; by which
                they who use the word as a term of reproach mean to convey&#44; that he attaches

                tinctured with humanity or feel&#8211; ings of mercy and benevolence&#59; and they
                therefore place far above him in the scale of merit the one who has what they call

                It is in&#8211; deed a fashion among certain classes of men to attach a great weight
                to their sentiments &#59; they aver that out&#8211; ward tokens&#44; resulting in
                deeds of piety&#44; are not of any significance&#44; so only the heart is all
                right&#59; and then they also allege that they can compensate for any deficiencies
                in actions by being charitable and kind&#44; and exercising neighbourly love on all
                occa&#8211; sions. But let us see what all this amounts to. Is religion founded in
                truth &#63; All answer&#44; &#34; Yes&#44; we do not dispute that.&#34; What does it

                duties and belief&#44; and enforces in regard to the former social acts and those
                properly originating in revela&#8211; tion solely. &#8212; But if the man who
                believes form to be necessary&#44; since it emanates from God&#44; or else it would
                not have been ordained&#44; insists on the equality of du&#8211; ties with spiritual

                candidly that the formalist is in the right&#44; the spirit&#8211; ualist totally in
                the wrong. The Bible knows noth&#8211; ing of a distinction between spirit and
                form&#44; it only knows of duties of deeds and duties of faith&#44; the first of
                which comprise outward acts&#44; whether consisting in commission or abstaining&#44;
                and the others enforce an acquiescence in the fundamental principles of be&#8211;
                lief which are contained in the records of revelation. Therefore&#44; whatever is
                taught in the Bible is&#44; if a deed&#44; important&#44; if a point of belief&#44;
                a religious truth &#59; and the true believer has&#44; therefore&#44; no choice but
                to conform to the one and to adopt the other&#44; if he be desirous of complying
                with the demands of Scripture. No one will say that a man of form acts justly if he
                defrauds his neighbour of his lawful property&#8211;&#59; if he slanders the
                absent&#59; if he gives bad advice&#59; or if he hardens his heart against the

                both of command and prohibition. The very constitution&#44; therefore&#44; of our
                law embraces belief and duty&#44; and the last is referable both to religion and
                humanity proper. The Legislator&#44; the God of Israel&#44; made no distinction
                &#59; He taught the whole in the presence of the nation whom He had chosen as his
                servants. What authorizes us then to distinguish&#44; to separate&#44; and to place
                one part above the other &#63; The whole clearly and truly belongs to the form of
                Juda&#8211; ism&#44; which is nothing else than the collection of the commandments
                which the Lord imparted to the pa&#8211; triarchs&#44; to Moses and to the
                Israelites&#44; as also the doctrines which are laid down in the revelation of the
                divine Mind communicated at various periods to the prophets both of the gentiles and
                of the Hebrews. In short&#44; the whole Bible is the doctrine of Israel &#59; there
                is no article of belief which can be rejected&#44; and no matter of duty which we
                are authorized to set aside. Everything which we are taught to believe is a portion
                of our creed &#59; whatever we are commanded to do belongs to the outward form of
                religion. Hon&#8211; esty&#44; humility&#44; truth&#44; and rectitude are therefore
                as much the proper characteristic of the Jew as circum&#8211; cision&#44; the
                observance of the Sabbath&#44; the abstaining from forbidden meats&#44; and the

                intellects whom the Father of all calls forward from time to time to illuminate the
                darkness around them&#44; though they are not prophets on that account. There was
                Socrates among the Greeks&#44; so likewise were Pythagoras&#44; Plato&#44; and

                fellow&#8211;men by the brilliancy of the light which burnt in their souls. But they

                ethics&#44; based upon the declaration of God himself with regard to his
                existence&#44; nature&#44; and powers. The God of Israel&#44; as He was graciously
                pleased to call himself&#44; because He had chosen our progenitor Israel as the
                father of a nation in covenant with Him&#44; declared that He exists&#44; first as
                One and alone&#44; with&#8211; out associate&#44; rival&#44; or other controlling
                influence&#59; secondly as the Eternal&#44; whose being is not limited by time and

                and fourthly&#44; as the Al&#8211; mighty Creator&#44; from whom all that is has
                emanated&#44; and who rules over all that exists by his sole will and power. There
                was left no room to doubt as to this doctrine&#44; because He interdicted the
                adoration of any beings in the whole range of nature beside himself&#44; because
                they do not exist with any independent power to aid&#44; to benefit&#44; or to
                injure man without his con&#8211; currence&#59; and as the announcement was for all

                when any other worship save that of the Lord Ahiiighty could become possible&#44;
                either by the assent of religion or the requirement of reason. JSTow it was on this
                basis of permanent adoration of the true God and Creator&#44; that in revealing
                him&#8211; self He founded a moral and civil government of the people whom He had
                chosen. It was not&#44; therefore&#44; a temporary legislation&#44; one liable to be
                repealed or rendered nugatory by subsequent circumstances&#59; but a permanent
                codification&#44; as we may call it&#44; which God contemplated&#44; and in order to
                make it readily acces&#8211; sible&#44; He comprised it in a few brief
                sentences&#44; which a child can readily learn by heart&#59; and to effect that it
                shall never be forgotten as the rule of our nation&#44; He connected it with living
                outward ceremonies of constant recurrence&#44; so that with each observance of the
                same&#44; the principles on which they are founded shall be culled to mind&#44; and
                that thereby the Author of the law may be strongly brought before the intel&#8211;

                there is no Cre&#8211; ator&#44; Preserver&#44; and Saviour. The form&#44;
                therefore&#44; is a vital part of the religion &#59; it is the distinguishing
                feature which characterizes it from all other merely speculative investigations in
                the nature&#44; substance and being of the Divine Power. That which cost
                uninstructed reason centuries to approach merely at a distance&#44; became to us
                evident in a moment through revelation &#59; and whereas systems of philosophy&#44;
                after all the labour bestowed on them&#44; never did become the principle for

                once rose to the importance of a guide in all things relating to the domestic and
                private life of Israelites and the code of their state. And the means employed to
                eftect this was the ceremonial law&#44; the form&#44; as modern scoifers would
                perhaps call it&#44; the outward shell&#44; as others designate the same&#44; which
                incloses the pure kernel of the truth of the Divine Existence. Now&#44; no one will
                say that the knowledge of our God is not the greatest benefit which we have received
                through the law&#59; but to maintain that the ceremonies are therefore of no
                importance&#44; is clearly to contradict the whole scheme of revelation. For the
                ceremonies were given to impress us&#44; as I hsfve said already&#44; at each
                performance thereof&#44; that they owed their origin to something in our relations
                to God&#44; and that we were ordered to do so because we were and are
                Israelites&#44; and because He was and is God. For instance&#44; with respect to the
                Sabbath&#44; it is said&#44; &#34; And the children of Israel shall keep the
                Sabbath&#44; to make the Sabbath throus&#39;hout their g&#8211;en&#8211; erations as
                an everlasting covenant. Between me and the children of Israel it is a sign
                forever&#44; that in six days the Lord made the heaven and the earth&#44; and on the
                seventh He rested and was refreshed.&#34; What is here stated to be the day of rest
                &#63; The sev&#8211; enth day&#44; commanded previously in the Ten Com&#8211;
                mandments. What is it to be &#63; A covenant&#44; or an agreement between Israelites
                on their part and their God on the other&#59; they promise by its observ&#8211; ance
                to be true and faithful subjects to their most holy King&#44; and He promises to
                bless and protect them&#44; and let his Spirit dwell with them. To the Is&#8211;
                raelites then it becomes a sign&#44; an evidence that they <pb n="108"/> 108 STRICT

                not look upon it&#44; as materialists do&#44; as com&#8211; posed of the original
                matters which always existed&#44; and assumed shape and form by a fortuitous
                succes&#8211; sion of circumstances&#44; but that it is a product of a supreme&#44;
                intelligent&#44; benevolent Power&#44; whose nature is unsearchable&#44; and whom no
                human means or intel&#8211; ligence can pretend to reach. Secondly they profess that
                the Creator of the world is also the Author of the Sabbath &#59; wherefore they are
                willing to abstain from lawful pursuits on the day which He has conse&#8211;
                crated&#44; because they believe that He has the right to ask this of those who live
                by his will&#44; and are sus&#8211; tained by his bounty. The Sabbath&#44;
                therefore&#44; is of great significance&#59; it is holy&#44; because the Lord so
                de&#8211; ckires it&#44; and in observing it we ofl&#39;er weekly the homage of our
                belief and trusting faith to the Creator of the world. Let me digress here a little.
                You see that the weekly day of rest is a sign&#44; a token of a covenant&#44; for
                which reason alone it is ordained. It is a form&#44; it is true&#44; and may&#44;
                for all we know&#44; have no influence on the life of him who observes it. But would
                you for this excuse disregard it &#63; or postpone it to some act of hunumity &#63;
                to the giving of alms&#44; or speaking comfort to a sufi&#39;erer&#63; Great and
                good as such acts are&#44; little though they cost the performer thereof&#44; they
                are not superior&#44; even if we take reason for our guide&#44; to humbling
                ourselves before the Lord&#44; and de&#8211; claring tliat He is our Master and our
                Benefactor&#44; and that we exist by his will solely&#44; and are account&#8211;
                able to none but Him. The form&#44; therefore&#44; is a sub&#8211; stantive part of
                religion&#44; and no one can say that he <pb n="109"/> STRICT OBEDIENCE. 109 Las the
                spirit of true fnitli within him&#44; if he refuses through carelessness or design
                to make that sacrifice of his worldly interests&#44; which the Sabbatic rest
                de&#8211; mands of him. Now the Sabbath has thus a meaning&#59; it is a bond of love
                between God and the world. But why &#63; be&#8211; cause God ordained it&#44; and
                not otherwise &#59; He insti&#8211; tuted it an emblem of his abstaining from the
                creative work at the beginning of things&#44; when He had fin&#8211; ished all the
                objects which He desired to call forth&#44; which idea is embraced in the word
                tyai&#39;i&#44; commonly translated refreshed&#44; but which is derived from the
                noun &#94;d&#58;&#44; originally soul&#44; but also used for &#34;will&#34; and
                &#34;pleasure&#44; &#34; wherefore we might have rendered it&#44; &#34; And He had
                attained his pleasure and purpose.&#34; Were it not then for this reason&#44; we
                should not be required to rest. But even the Lord&#44; if we may say so&#44; rested
                from his work&#44; and He consecrated the seventh period of time for the purpose of
                commem&#8211; orating this mighty thought &#58; now this is the cause&#44; and no
                other&#44; which demands primarily of us to ob&#8211; serve the Sabbath. Can
                therefore any other event deserve a similar consecration &#63; or what is more&#44;
                have we in reason any warrant for demanding of each other to abstain weekly from
                labour on a particular day other than the one instituted in the Decalogue&#63; But
                it is evidently&#39; either that one or none&#59; either we must obey the whole
                requirement of the fourth com&#8211; mandment&#44; or abrogate it altogether&#44;
                granting that we have the right to do so&#44; which is&#44; however&#44; not the
                ease&#59; since no authority whatever can destroy what the Lord has ordained.

                a cov&#8211; enant into which they have never yet entered&#44; despite of all their
                ingenious false pleading. They therefore are permitted to set aside&#44; by civil
                enactments or by religious councils&#44; any one day in seven&#44; to abstain
                thereon from labour&#59; but it is absurd&#44; contrary to religion&#44; to call it
                the Sabbath&#59; for this it is not&#44; and it never can be so either &#59; the law
                is fixed for a par&#8211; ticular day&#59; the signification of it is peculiar and
                un&#8211; changeable &#59; no other event&#44; real or imaginary&#44; can therefore
                stamp any other day out of the seven with the seal of divine approbation&#44; more
                especially if it is contended that such an institution has repealed the true day of
                the Lord&#44; the seventh day Sabbath. But how much more sinful must it be in men
                who call themselves the sons of Jacob debating about trans&#8211; ferring the
                Sabbath to the first day &#59; and how un&#8211; reasonable is it for them to

                ligion is not perfect without a careful observance of form&#44; that is&#44; an
                implicit obedience to the divine com&#8211; mandments. These include all the
                requirements of humanity&#44; not excepting one deed of mercy&#44; not one act of
                benevolence&#59; wherefore in falfilliiig them we precisely accomplish our task on
                eartli in every re&#8211; spect. Whatever&#44; therefore&#44; of positive precepts
                we have received is equally sacred with all others&#59; we cannot distinguish
                between the holiness of one com&#8211; mand and of the other&#44; because we lack

                sorrowful indignation at the hard fate which was the lot of our people for so many

                Suspired wisdom wo owe our form of prayers&#44; for inditing words which are not
                founded in truth&#44; and thus inducing us to offer up an insincere oftering before

                take a careful view of what was eftected through our dehverance from Egypt&#44; you
                will be convinced that the prayer is one which the lover of truth may freely

                answer to the objection which may thus have been raised in your mind. There is
                something in domestic slavery&#44; a state in which one man is entirely subjected to
                an&#8211; other&#39;s will&#44; which is well calculated to crush all feel&#8211;

                can impart. At the time of our residence on the shores of the Nile it was not as now
                that literature is sent widely over the earth in a million of publications of
                various kinds&#44; and thus reaches occasionally even the bondmen like&#8211; wise

                therefore not within the reach of those who were regarded as inferior by their proud
                masters. Even as it is this day&#44; that learning is so generally diffused&#44; the
                grossest ignorance is the lot of the shive&#44; nay in this country&#44; which
                justly boasts of its refine&#8211; ment and advance in civilization &#58; how much
                more is it then to be expected that almost total mental darkness must have rested on

                superior mental capacity of the Abrahamic race above all others was enabled to
                preserve them from the fate of all other bondmen. But if we regard what travellers
                say about the ignorance of the slaves in Oriental coun&#8211; tries&#44; of men and
                women fairer and more beautiful than our own people&#44; with minds as capacious for
                knowledge as anv other class of men &#58; it would as&#8211; suredly look like
                presumption to imagine that we alone of all mankind should be able&#44; under any
                cir&#8211; cumstance&#44; to escape the contagion of debasing influ&#8211;
                ences&#44; so as to be elevated above the fate which natu&#8211; rally befalls other
                classes so situated as we were in Egypt. Experience farther teaches us that slaves
                by degrees lose their religions identity&#44; and they become in a few ages at
                farthest what their masters wish them to be &#59; and for this history may be
                appealed to as establishing the point beyond dispute&#59;&#42; and we con&#8211;

                religious practices&#44; and imbibing the religious notions which their masters
                teach them. Taking this view of the subject we only come to the conviction that&#44;
                in addition to the bodily slavery which we had to submit to in Egypt&#44; our souls
                were doomed to an equal&#44; nay to a deeper state of degra&#8211; dation&#44; and
                that we must have learned to conform our acts and thoughts to the pattern set us by
                our task&#8211; masters. It is indeed the opinion of some of our teachers that we
                had sunk deeply in the uncleauness of the refined idolaters who then bore rule over
                us&#44; and that we had forgotten the God of our fathers&#44; who is holy and true.
                It is according to this idea nothing very wonderful that Moses found it perhaps as
                difficult to convince the Israelites of the truth of his mission&#44; as he did in
                obtaining their freedom from Pharaoh. It was unbelief engendered by hardship&#44;
                aided by the bad example of the Egyptians&#44; which closed their hearts against the
                message of liberation&#44; whilst selfishness and pride produced the same result in
                the mind of the king. You will therefore under&#8211; stand the message which God
                delivered to Moses in Exodus vi. 6&#44; 7&#44; &#34; Therefore say unto the children
                of Israel&#44; I am the Lord&#44; and I will bring you out from under the burdens of
                the Egyptians&#44; and I will rid you out of their bondage&#44; and I will redeem
                you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments&#59; and I will take you to me
                for a people&#44; and I will be to you for a God&#59; and ye shall know that I am
                the Lord your God&#44; who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the
                Egyptians.&#34; The only meaning of this passage is iu the simplest form&#44; that

                &#59; and hence the Lord promises that He would so act towards their oppressors&#44;
                that He would so entirely remove the burdens resting upon them&#44; and elFect all
                this in so extraordinary a manner&#44; that they would have to acknowledge that the
                Being who would do this must indeed be the almighty&#44; eternal&#44; and only
                One&#44; who spoke to them by the messenger whom He had sent to them. Let us&#44;
                therefore&#44; assume it as proved that the moral state of our fathers was sunk very
                low when the Most High appeared as an Avenger of their wrongs&#44; and caused&#44;
                through the death of the first&#8211;born of the Egyptians&#44; the mandate of their
                dismissal to be pro&#8211; nounced by lips that formerly defied the power of the

                mortal could have encom&#8211; passed&#44; and which&#44; therefore&#44; struck
                terror into the hearts of the most obdurate. Men could resist the horrors of all the
                plagues which desolated their land&#44; and laid bare their fields&#59; they
                could&#44; at the recur&#8211; rence of any new calamity&#44; fortify their

                then wore&#44; nor wrought such manifold and diversified mis&#8211; chief in any

                millions of slaves which was eflected &#59; for it is possible that this might have
                been accomplished through the free assent of their rulers&#44; if their in&#8211;
                terest had prompted them to accomplish so improb&#8211; able an act of grace. But
                the manner in which it was forced upon the obdurate worshippers of a mul&#8211;
                titude of gods&#44; compelled them to acknowledge that there exists a Power far

                wrought through the Exodus from Egypt&#44; the one of the body&#44; the other of the
                spirit. The unchained slaves were not sent over the earth like a herd of savage
                beasts loosened from their dens to sweep over the earth to destroy and to devour
                &#59; but they were taken from a fruitful land where the bland sky and fair earth
                unite to sloth and repose&#44; whilst they also excite to cruelty and the
                forgetfuluess of other men&#39;s wrongs and sor&#8211; rows&#44; and carried into
                the howling wilderness of the stony Arabia&#44; to be educated in the school of
                afflic&#8211; tion and hunger&#44; in the absence of luxury and enjoy&#8211;
                ment&#44; to become familiar with higher joys&#44; with a spiritual elevation&#44;

                the king consented to let them go free&#59; but there was still a cloud on their
                soul&#44; a darkness overshadowing their spirit&#44; which had to yield before their
                freedom was finally accomplished. It would have been nothing in the divine economy

                than our shivery&#44; to the world at large. Why it is&#44; we cannot tell&#59; but
                we find oppression ni all ages&#44; and the afflicted shed tears of anguish&#44;
                with none to behold them save the One who sees and governs all. But as everything
                has its use&#44; so must affliction also&#44; even when falling on harge masses&#44;
                have its beneficial ends&#59; and the lives of the sufferers from other&#39;s
                wrongs&#44; we may be assured&#44; will not be left unfruitful in the general
                result&#44; which is gradually filling up the distant vista in the field of history
                Man&#39;s life in&#8211; dividually&#44; too&#44; is not limited by the years he
                lives on earth &#59; his end&#44; therefore&#44; is not reached when he breathes his

                endured even for a long time&#44; leave him still ages of unalloyed happiness&#44;
                which he may enjoy should his conduct merit a happy future. The simple bondage of
                our fathers in Egypt could not&#44; therefore&#44; have elicited all the display of
                divine power&#44; if nothing but their bodily freedom could have been effected&#59;
                or else we must accuse God of injustice for allowing the powerful to oppress the
                weak in by far larger masses tlian were our fathers in Egypt. The divine
                economy&#39;&#44; as I have said&#44; must&#44; therefore&#44; have had a far higher

                and unbelief. In fact we read&#44; also&#44; in the first revelation which Moses
                received &#40;Exod. iii. 12&#41;&#44; &#34;And this shall be unto thee a token that

                and to live at ease&#44; to be mere mortals in taste and habit&#44; that the Lord
                revealed himself to us&#59; but that we might learn to worship Him&#44; to know his
                ways&#44; and to fear his word. Horeb had been the scene where Moses&#39;s
                enraptured eye was first startled by the miracle of a brilliant fire&#39;s not
                consuming the stunted bush which grew in the desert&#44; where the flame raged in
                unsurpassed splendour without bringing destruction to that shrub on which it
                apparently fed&#59; and it was&#44; therefore&#44; that very spot which was chosen
                as the scene of a yet higher&#44; brighter&#44; more brilliant and wonderful
                ilki&#8211; mination&#44; as the spot where the law was to be kindled in the souls
                of those who fear the Lord&#44; where&#44; too&#44; it shall burn without consuming
                on what it feeds&#44; but lend it strength and beauty&#44; becoming brighter and
                fairer as the physical forces diminish&#44; and to shine with a renewed light&#44;
                even when the mortal frame has fallen into death and decay. If even darkness should

                land of the children of Ham&#44; it was not to remain long there to check the growth
                of a new hope and of the new faith which had just been planted there&#59; but it was
                decreed that they should travel onward to the mountain of Horeb&#44; to learn there
                how to live as men in covenant with the Lord. We may&#44; tlierefore&#44; explain
                allegorically the verse 17 of Exod. xiii. &#58; &#34; And it came to pass when

                only lead us into error and mischief&#59; since there is nothing in human reason to
                be always certain and sure&#44; both in acts and in thoughts. No matter therefore
                how good and wise a man may be&#44; we cannot implicitly follow his advice&#59; but

                the inspired poet&#59; and in surety there is peace on the way which is marked out

                the divine will which has been imparted to us&#44; and by which alone we can safely
                direct our conduct. If now we praise God for the everlasting freedom which was
                imparted to us when the first&#8211;born of Egypt were slain&#44; it is not merely
                for the breaking of the chains of slavery&#44; which dismissed us forever from the
                service of our oppressors&#44; but also for the divine enlightenment which we
                received in consequence of that event. And ever since we have been distin&#8211;

                Iloreb were we the only people who knew of the truths as there revealed&#44; and to
                this very day we are the only ones who walk in the true and simple light of the
                Lord&#58; whilst every other people follows out what its fallible human teachers
                have endeavoured to impose on the world as the only truth. But&#44; alas&#33; that
                we should be com&#8211; pelled to say it&#44; we were not left unmolested in thus
                pursuing the object of our selection &#59; with fierce cruelty nation after nation

                and the wantonness of malice invented daily new tortures to aid it in its warfare
                against the Lord and his priest&#8211; ly kingdom. But He who called our father

                on to see the fruit devoured by those who laboured only for its destruction &#59;
                but still the stem has not lost its vigour&#44; and it draws to &#42; Compare with

                &#59; and in defending&#44; therefore&#44; what we have received as a heavenly

                wonderful how easily many satisfy their conscience in regard to the amount of their
                exertions. &#34; We have done enough&#44; all that can be expected&#44; &#34; is
                often heard when we are asked concerning our spiritual labours. But how would it

                wanting in their duty be found to have left undone nearly everything which was
                practical and accessible to them. It is very easy to frame a measure of our own

                Lord of glory&#33; Thou who didst shine forth unto thy people&#44; when Thou didst
                teach them thy law on Mount Sinai&#44; and cause them to hear thy words from the
                midst of the flames of fire&#44; deign to enlighten our spirit likewise in the
                manner Thou didst unto our forefathers. They lived in an age when thy worship was
                known to only a few who had not forgotten thy instruction&#59; wherefore Thou didst
                vouchsafe to take unto thyself a nation redeemed from the midst of an&#8211; other
                nation&#44; to be the bearers of thy truth and thy law to the ends of the earth. And
                we have now arisen after them&#44; their descendants and lieirs&#44; like them
                edu&#8211; cated to be thy heritage&#44; like them alone among the families of the

                power to prevail by the strength of numbers&#44; nor by the use of carnal arms&#59;
                for since we have been taken to be thy ser&#8211; vants we have ever continued few
                among the sons of man&#44; though disthiguished among all&#44; as the young lion

                Thou hast be&#8211; stowed on us as the heritage of the congregation of Jacob. So
                shall we also in our persons and those of our descendants continue to be thy

                promulgation of the law from the summit of Sinai&#44; it is the anni&#8211; versary
                of the birthday of the people of Israel&#44; and of the birthday of enlightened
                civilization and men&#8211; tal freedom. Compare it to any other day that ever
                dawned since the creation&#44; and all sink into insignifi&#8211; cance before it.
                And well was it ushered in after the manner it is described in the Bible &#58; <pb
                    n="145"/> THE INSTRUCTION AT SINAI. 145 &#34; And it came to pass on the third
                day&#44; at the dawn of the morn&#8211; ing&#44; that there were tliunders and
                lightnings&#44; and a heavy cloud was upon the mount&#44; and the voice of the
                cornet was exceedingly loud &#59; so that all the people that were in the camp
                trembled.&#34; Exod. xix. 16. Fifty clays before that day the Israelites hud gone
                out from the land of their long and weary servitude&#59; since then the Red Sea had
                been divided for them&#44; and they had passed through on dry ground&#44; between
                piled up walls of mighty waters&#59; the spring of Marah&#44; unfit for drink&#44;
                had been made sweet for them through the means of the tree which the prophet had
                been bidden to cast into the water&#44; upon the in&#8211; spiration of the Most
                High &#59; manna had been show&#8211; ered down unto them from heaven&#44; tliat
                they might eat bread for which they had not laboured&#44; and be fed abundantly in a
                land which cannot be sown&#59; again the rock of Horeb was made to send forth
                co&#8211; pious streams on being struck by the staff of the prophet&#44; by which
                the congregation and their cattle had enough to drink&#59; and when at last the
                warlike hordes of Amalek had surprised them&#44; whilst they were faint and weary in
                the desert&#44; they had success&#8211; fully overcome this danger too under the
                guidance of the son of Nun&#44; upheld as he was by the prayer of Moses. Thus every
                step they had taken had been to them a new evidence of the power and mercy of their
                Redeemer&#59; and now had dawned the day on which they had been told that the Lord
                would ap&#8211; pear to them in a thick cloud&#44; to speak in their pres&#8211;
                ence with the man who had been made the instrument of their redemption. And what a
                dawn it was&#33; such a one as no man ever saw&#44; and as probably will not VOL.

                of the dead&#44; when all shall be adjudged to life or to death&#44; as the Lord may
                deem them deserving. And lo &#33; all around them the sky was serene &#59; but on
                Sinai there rested a thick cloud&#44; and from the centre of that cloud there
                is&#8211; sued forth flash upon flash&#44; and one roll of thunder followed on the
                other&#44; and the sound of the cornet blown by invisible beings&#44; not tired by
                the exertion&#44; but increasing in strength and distinctness as the sounds were
                produced&#59; and all was harmony and glory amidst the convulsion of Nature which
                alone affected the mount chosen for the day as the residence of the Holy One of
                Israel. Well might the people tremble at beholding so strong a display of the awful
                power of Ilim they were called on to adore &#59; it was proper that they should feel
                dread when assured that what they then saw was done&#44; that they might learn to
                know that their God is the everlasting One&#44; and that from Ilim alone proceed
                true knowledge and wis&#8211; dom. It was a fitting close to the work of their
                i&#8211;e&#8211; demption commenced so many days before&#59; they had been upheld
                amidst the rush of water&#59; the din of battle &#59; the thirst and famine
                attending on those who traverse the wilderness in a state so unprovided as they
                were&#59; and now they were in the presence of their Master&#44; at the foot of the
                throne of Him who had wrought all this in their behalf&#59; they were ad&#8211;
                mitted to the very precincts of the majesty of the Governor of the world&#44; in
                order that they might be taught simple truths&#44; wholesome commandments&#44; so
                that they might be fitted to be servants&#44; intelli&#8211; gent followers of the
                great King of the universe. Put it was not merely an idle pageant which they <pb

                terror on the present beholders that the Lord did descend on that day &#59; but the
                object was that what was seen then should not be forgotten&#44; and that the
                impression should remain indelibly fixed to all generations. For these are the words
                of Scripture&#44; &#34; That the people may liear when I speak to thee&#44; and in
                thee also they shall believe forever.&#34; The words which were then to be spoken
                should not be like other words&#44; to be re&#8211; membered or forgotten as
                circumstances may favour&#44; or otherwise&#59; but no&#59; they were to become
                incor&#8211; porated with the feelings&#44; habits&#44; and thoughts of the
                people&#59; they should become their religion&#44; their morals&#44; their political
                code&#59; they should be applicable to infancy&#44; youth&#44; manhood&#44; and
                decrepit age&#59; suited for male and female&#59; for bondman and master&#59; for
                the poor and the rich&#59; for the simple and the wise&#59; and in this manner they
                should be remembered for&#8211; ever&#44; and the mission of the prophet&#44;
                through whom they were afterwards delivered to the custody of the people on the two
                tables of the covenant&#44; should be confided in whilst one of their descendants
                remained on earth. If now the unbeliever should say doubt&#8211; ingly&#44; &#34;
                Can it be true that the Most High should speak to man on earth &#63; who can believe
                that He who governs the world&#44; and sustains all with his will&#44; should

                though the subjects had ceased&#59; for even now they are all the products of his
                creation. We assert&#44; therefore&#44; as an established truth&#44; that the
                dignity of God is not injured by his cognizance of all existing things&#44; as
                little as He is circumscribed by distance and difficulties from effect&#8211; ing
                his will. jSTo man is&#44; therefore&#44; removed from his watchfulness&#44; even
                assuming that he is insignificant and unworthy in the estimation of his Maker&#59;
                simply because it requires in him no exertion&#44; no extraor&#8211; dinary care to
                bestow his watchfulness on all. But we have no right to suppose that God is
                indifferent to the fate and the deeds of his creatures. He has created them &#59; He
                has fashioned them &#59; He feeds and sustains them&#59; He gives beauty to the

                tieet&#8211; ness to the eagle&#59; He clothes the hills with verdure&#44; and
                imparts wisdom to the wise&#59; He does all this and more&#44; yea much more than
                the tongue can tell &#58; and is He&#44; can He&#44; be careless of that which

                and astonishment. For events are linked to events&#59; no man sees how the chain is

                Yea&#44; our God is great&#44; and holy is his word&#59; his wisdom is
                unsearchable&#44; and there is no end to his mercy and goodness. And whatever He

                care&#44; of the Creator&#39;s mercy&#63; The very statement of the cpiestion
                carries its own answer along&#44; and it says&#44; then&#44; that the care for the
                spirit&#44; the instruction of the mind in true wisdom&#44; must be the chief object
                of the God who is all&#8211;good and all&#8211; wise &#59; or in other words&#44; we
                must assume that not alone was it consonant with the dignity of God to become
                Himself the Teacher of mankind&#44; but that it would be impugning his benevolence
                and truth to assume that He neglected giving them instruction. He might indeed have
                so constituted man&#44; that he should know precisely what is right or wrong&#44;
                true or false. But He has not done so&#44; or else there would be but one standard
                of right and truth for all mankind. Xow we know that this is not the case&#59;
                consequently we are brouglit to the other prerequisite to reconcile the goodness
                with the justice of the Lord&#44; and this is&#44; that He has imparted&#44; at some
                time and somewhere&#44; to some one or many&#44; the precise knowledge of right and
                truth&#59; and we claim the period of the Exodus from Egypt as the time&#44; the
                Mount Horeb as the place&#44; and the people of Israel as the persons &#8212; as the
                when&#44; where&#44; and to whom the law or revelation of God was given. Enough for
                us&#44; as evidence of all this&#44; that we possess a law clear and emphatic in its
                teaching con&#8211; cerning God&#44; ample and satisfactory with respect to <pb
                    n="152"/> 152 THE INSTRUCTION AT SINAI. its demands of duties at our hands&#59;
                and we claim that without a divine special interposition no such law could have been
                framed&#44; no such law could liave been promulgated&#59; as since the time named
                nothing like it has been discovered. You may yet say&#44; that the proof is not
                complete &#59; that other laws besides that known as the Mosaic law have been
                promulgated&#44; or announced rather&#44; as of divine orio&#58;in. But not to enter
                into a diffuse arsiu.&#8211; ment&#44; we must confine ourselves to one point. Its
                divinity is proved&#44; first&#44; by its consistency&#44; by its brevity&#44; by
                its permanency. Look at our constitu&#8211; tion&#44; I mean the Ten
                Commandments&#44; and you dis&#8211; cover reason and duty conjoined in them in one
                in&#8211; separable union. The first principle laid down&#44; to build thereon the
                system of duties&#44; is the simple an&#8211; nouncement&#44; that there exists an
                eternal&#44; omnipotent God&#44; who governs and surveys all things&#44; who is our
                Protector and Benefactor. He is announced as the One who created the world&#44; and
                leaves nothing with&#8211; out bestowing on it his attention&#44; either to reward
                or to punish. That this must be so&#44; is evident to human reason &#59; we are
                endowed with intelligence&#44; this Ave feel&#44; this we know&#44; if we feel and
                know anything whatever&#59; but as this intelligence is diverse and un&#8211; equal
                in the same person even&#44; not to mention differ&#8211; ent individuals&#44; we
                come to the conclusion&#44; as the only natural one&#44; that our wisdom is derived
                from a higher Source&#44; which lor want of a better term we will call the Supreme
                Intelligence. If now a Supreme Intelligence does exist&#44; and if He has by his
                emana&#8211; tion endowed many inferior beings with a minor but substantial
                intelligence &#58; it is evident that lie has a <pb n="153"/> THE INSTRUCTION AT
                SINAI. 153 right to hold thein responsible for wliatcver deeds thej do within the
                scope of their capacity. Hence the reasonableness of rewards and punishments&#59;
                hence the perfection of the Decalogue in making liappiness or unhappiness depend
                upon an obedience to the precepts of tlie Supreme Intelligence on the part of those
                who have received life&#44; light&#44; benefits&#44; and free&#8211; dom of will as
                their characteristic as human beings. And in order to render the truths as
                comprehensive as thej are necessary&#44; our law presents them in a few brief
                sentences&#44; which can be easily committed to memory&#44; and be understood
                without any learned definitions&#44; so that they may be accessible to the commonest
                intellect. ITow this very character has imparted to our faith its permanence&#59; a
                child could be and was taught whilst it dallied on its mother&#39;s lap&#59; its
                memory could not recall the time when the main principles of our religion Avere
                strange dogmas to its awakening intellect&#59; and as the man advaliced in life&#44;
                experience proved to him how happily the ob&#8211; servance of his religion acted in
                every emergency of life&#44; and how bitterly he had to sufter for every gross
                delinquency. What theory thus established&#44; experi&#8211; ence fully confirmed
                &#59; and hence our religion became incorporated with our very being&#44; and altthe
                endeav&#8211; ours of men&#44; nay our own frequent apostacy&#44; could never take
                from us the word of the Lord which is in our mouth. Now&#44; other religions do
                indeed claim to be divine&#59; but can they stand an examination by this test &#63;
                We may freely say that they cannot&#44; at least to our view they cannot&#59; they
                are mostly lacking in consistency&#59; built upon arbitrary dogmas&#59; artificial

                never been tested hy the fire of iifflic&#8211; tion as ours has been. But in
                addition to this&#44; all those systems which have any reasonable consistency were
                borrowed from Judaism &#59; they are not one of them original &#59; not one of them
                can do more than point to the Bible as to authority&#59; and whilst this is so&#44;
                we may justly say&#44; that whatever of life such a re&#8211; ligion possesses is
                derived either mediately or imme&#8211; diately from that Source of truth from which
                we draw the water of life. We have thus established that it was a mighty and
                brilliant deed the Lord meant to accomplish in his descent on Sinai&#59; and well
                fitting was the fearful dis&#8211; play of royal power to solemnize the event. There
                were lightnings and earthquake&#44; but no one was in&#8211; jured&#59; there were
                the terrors all of the mighty Sove&#8211; reign&#44; but no evil befell any one of
                the vast throng that stood at the foot of the blazing mount&#59; nay&#44; the very
                earth was not riven by the awful convulsion W&#39;hich shook the hills when the Lord
                proceeded in his glory and might from Seir&#44; and came in his majesty from
                Baran&#44; and the terrific fire blazed up to the heart of heaven&#44; but not a
                bush was consumed&#44; not a leaf was seared or burnt&#59; and when the august
                dis&#8211; play of the divine manifestation was over&#44; the traces&#44; the
                outward tokens of the Breseuce had disappeared likewise&#44; and the grass was as
                green as ever&#44; and at the foot of Horeb flowed the tranquil stream of the
                desert&#59; but there remained indelible and everlasting the sound of the Voice
                which was heard by all&#44; and our latest descendants will still exclaim as we do
                this day&#58; &#34;All the words which the Lord hath spoken will we do.&#34; The

                wouldst be our God forever. Amen. Brethren &#33; The section of the law which we
                have read this mornmg commences as follows &#58; &#34;Send thou men that they may
                spy out the land of Canaan&#44; which I give unto the children of Israel &#59; one

                prince among them.&#34; NumbCirs xiii. 2. In reading the history of the spying out
                of the land of Canaan&#44; it has no doubt struck you&#44; as it has done many who
                have lived before your time&#44; as singular that the Lord should permit Moses to
                send out spies&#44; when it must have been known beforehand that the men deputed to
                survey the land of Canaan would re&#8211; turn with substantially a false&#44;
                because exaggerated&#44; report of the difficulties and dangers to be encoun&#8211;
                tered in conquering and settling the fertile districts of Palestine&#44; owing&#44;
                as they subsequently alleged&#44; to the natural strength of the country&#44; the
                great height of the people in bodily stature&#44; the artificial forti&#8211;
                fications of the cities&#44; and at length the extreme uiihealthiness of the
                climate. But to argue simply <pb n="159"/> PROVIDENCE IN HISTORY. 159 from the
                foreknowledge which God possesses because He is God&#44; in qnalitj of which all the
                deeds of his creatures are known to Ilini&#44; and then to insist that the evil
                ought to have been prevented&#44; because lie Las the power to order it otherwise
                &#8212; would be to de&#8211; mand at once a total abrogation of the freedom of will
                which characterizes the human family above all the animated beings which inhabit the
                earth. We however feel a conviction within ourselves that we Lave an uncontrolled
                power to choose between differ&#8211; ent acts presented to us&#59; that we can
                prefer the fol&#8211; lowing of one sentiment to the other&#44; and that we can
                argue within ourselves whether we shall obey one impulse or the other. This then
                proves that we have a freedom of will&#44; by which I mean&#44; not that we can do
                whatever we please&#44; but that we can omit or do any act for the time being within
                our power&#44; without being withheld by any influence not inherent in our own
                selves. ISTow you will ask&#44; &#34; What becomes of God&#39;s foreknowledge&#44;
                or prescience &#63;&#34; But we must consider one thing that&#44; as we are not
                divine ourselves&#44; our ideas being all limited to time and space as we dis&#8211;
                cover them in our imperfect experience through life&#44; it must be utterly
                impossible to comprehend completely the working of the mind of God&#44; who is not
                bound and circumscribed as we are. We&#44; when we know a thing must happen unless
                we use timely precautions to prevent the threatened result&#44; are compelled to do
                so&#44; because we Lave no other means to avert a per&#8211; manent evil&#59; our
                apprehensions become our masters&#44; our necessity&#44; and we must act under their
                impulse&#44; or lose our advantage forever. In this matter&#44; too&#44; cir&#8211;

                theless no control over the antecedent events which occurred up to the moment in
                which we find ourselves&#44; and hence we are the creatures not of absolute

                mean&#44; circumscribed by the means at our command&#44; or the superior means at
                the command of others. We act in a limited sphere&#44; and beyond this our
                power&#44; influence or control must necessarily and absolutely cease. With the
                divine Mind&#44; liowever&#44; the case is totally dift&#39;erent. He need not
                prevent any act from fear of the ultimate evil which can result therefrom&#44;
                because the remedy is always within his reach. The opportune moment need not be
                seized by Him&#44; be&#8211; cause every moment is the same to Him&#44; and all
                times are to his omnipotence alike propitious and season&#8211; able. ISTor need He
                wait for opportunity&#44; for circum&#8211; stance to exert his power and will&#44;
                because his means are unlimited&#44; and He can&#44; as He does&#44; shape the
                cir&#8211; cumstances to answer his wise purposes. Besides this we cannot understand
                the Infinite&#44; nor comprehend how his providence is exercised&#44; and his wisdom
                ex&#8211; erted. To us there is or may seem an absolute in&#8211; compatibility
                between his foreknowledge and our freedom of will &#59; since if He knows that a
                thing is to happen&#44; there is an insurmountable necessity that it must happen
                &#59; for otherwise his knowledge would be at fault&#44; or what is the same&#44; it
                would cease to be knowledge. But we may take it for granted as taught by the Rabbins
                that &#34; everything is the power of Heav&#8211; en except the fear of
                Heaven&#59;&#34; the choice of doing good or evil is absolutely within man&#39;s
                control &#59; where&#8211; fore the knowledge of God cannot act as an uncoii&#8211;

                reconcile&#44; how&#8211; ever&#44; the difiiculty with his attribute of omniscience
                is a task beyond human power. Whilst here we are not alone limited in strength&#44;
                but circumscribed in comprehension &#59; but God is unlimited&#44; uncircum&#8211;
                scribed&#44; wherefore we must of necessity be unabJe to comprehend fully his mind
                or his system of govern&#8211; ment. In consequence of this our search for
                knowl&#8211; edge should confine itself to things likely to be reached by our
                efibrts&#59; but we must leave out of its field of labour whatever absolutely
                touches the In&#8211; finite One in his far&#8211;reaching wisdom and power with
                which He governs all creation. Even to frame a conjecture&#44; a probable solution
                of the difiiculty&#44; would be useless&#44; inasmuch as we cannot arrive at an
                abso&#8211; lute certainty&#44; and anything short of this would leave us precisely
                where we commenced&#44; and the most we could arrive at would be to acknowledo&#59;e
                that man cannot judge his Maker. The study of Scripture and its best exponent
                his&#8211; tory teach us one great principle&#44; however&#59; and this is&#44; that
                notwithstanding man may distort the pre&#8211; cepts of truth and wisdom he has
                received&#44; he is restricted from effecting all the evil he may have de&#8211;
                signed&#59; for he is held in check by the unseen Hand which wields the sceptre in
                the vast empire of the universe. Secondly&#44; that however God knows all that has
                happened or will happen&#44; man is not thereby prevented from exercising a limited
                freedom in all things subject to his control&#44; and that the only prop&#8211; er
                restraining power is within the reach of those cir&#8211; cumstances in which every
                man is placed&#44; from the moment of his birth to the final close of earthly life.

                Gocl but his provi&#8211; dence which shapes the course of events&#59; it is not
                necessity&#44; unavoidable fate wliich controls the world&#44; but a watchful
                government wliich takes cognizance of the most unimportant&#44; the most minute
                event which occurs from one extreme of the world to the other&#58; so that&#44; as
                far as the government of the entire crea&#8211; tion is concerned&#44; it is wisdom

                neces&#8211; sity upon which all events are based. As I said before&#44;
                however&#44; to reconcile the apparent difficulty is not in our power&#59; it is
                enough for us that we have arrived at an absolutely ascertained truth&#44; and our
                entire want of comprehending it diminishes its force no more&#44; than other truths
                are incontrovertible from the mere fact that we cannot bring them in entire
                accordance with our reason&#44; through our means and opportunities of arriving at
                perfect knowledge. The Bible therefore&#44; in giving us a history of oc&#8211;
                currences which so greatly interest us&#44; describes things as they actually
                were&#44; not as we might suppose they ouo&#8211;lit to have been &#58; still we can
                trace the fiu2&#58;er of Providence in the whole chain of events&#44; and we can
                point out to a certainty how its controlling influence was exercised to cause good
                to spring out of evil&#44; how therefore an unmitigated calamity is not to be
                thought of&#44; as far as the whole mass of men is concerned&#44; though it is
                undoubted that individuals have had&#44; or may still have to suffer many a wrong
                which we&#44; from our point of view&#44; may be inclined to pronounce un&#8211;
                deserved&#44; and for that matter&#44; useless likewise. But as we do not know more
                than what falls under our observation&#44; which&#44; whatever our vanity may
                allege. <pb n="163"/> PROVIDENCE IN HISTORY. 163 is extremely vague and limited&#44;
                we cannot pronounce judgment with any degree of truth&#44; except upon a very few
                cases&#44; perhaps not a single one&#44; if the whole truth could be ascertained.
                Look at the administra&#8211; tion of justice&#44; as you see it daily before
                you&#44; and can you say that a verdict has been rendered so as to sat&#8211; isfy
                the judges themselves who pronounce it&#63; But regard well the array of legal
                talent called forth to sift the truth to the bottom &#59; the acumen of the
                judges&#59; the care taken to examine the witnesses&#44; all more or less cognizant
                of some fact or part of a cir&#8211; cumstance attending the matter which is under
                in&#8211; vestigation &#59; and then reflect that after all this labour the result
                does not bring conviction home to you that justice has been clone in the
                premises&#59; and you will have enough to satisfy you&#44; that human reason or
                ex&#8211; perience is a very unsafe guide to ascertain the whole truth of
                things&#44; if not guided by the inspiration of the highest Wisdom&#44; from which
                all knowledge proceeds&#44; Now it is this same Wisdom which we arraign when
                condemning as unworthy of a good Providence the whole history of the world&#59; when
                we&#44; blind&#44; prejudiced&#44; ignorant as we are&#44; know not to decide
                understandingly on the very acts in which we ourselves bear a conspicuous part. But
                let us humbly sit down to investigate what the records of the past have taught
                us&#44; let us inspect the peculiar position which each of us holds in consequence
                of circumstances which urged him forward &#58; and we can&#8211; not help feeling
                convinced that nothing happens by chance&#44; but weal or wo&#44; sickness or
                health&#44; affluence or poverty&#44; are assigned with a due care to the wel&#8211;

                shown to him&#44; more than those who suffer under the inflictions from which he is
                exempt&#59; but nevertheless we may rest assured that the distribution of the divine
                favours&#44; as all blessings we enjoy abso&#8211; lutely are&#44; has been
                contrived in the wisest and best possible manner. Another thing in this connexion
                which we must take cognizance of is&#44; that miracles&#44; or events beyond the
                usual course of the laws of nature&#44; are of ex&#8211; tremely rare
                recurrence&#44; even in Scriptural history &#59; and only when necessity demands
                does the Lord com&#8211; mand his servant&#44; the natural organization of
                things&#44; to cease acting for a brief time&#44; in order that He may ordain new
                laws to work his will&#44; and to control the tide of passing events. In the
                majority of cases&#44; how&#8211; ever&#44; the Most High seizes apparently on the
                most trifling event&#44; and causes it to become the germ of mighty revolutions&#44;
                or those turning&#8211;points wdiich give to the history of man an entirely new
                complexion. Just look at the simple history of Joseph. He was the eleventh son of
                Jacob&#44; born when the latter was far advanced in life&#44; the child of is early
                and best beloved wife&#59; and what was more natural than that he should love him
                above his other children &#63; and to give him a garment somewhat more costly than
                to the others&#63; And still it was this little circumstance which caused Israel and
                his sons to go down to Egypt&#44; there to increase to become a mighty people&#44;
                and to prepare themselves for the great mission for which Abraham and his
                descendants were destined. Let any one survey the ease and regularity with which one
                event was linked to the other&#44; until the day that <pb n="165"/> PROVIDENCE IN
                HISTORY. 165 our fathers stood around the foot of Iloreb to receive the law&#44; and
                it will appear most wonderful how truly tlie promise to Abraham was
                accomplished&#44; and this through the favour which Jacob felt for Joseph. The
                manner was left to the free&#8211;will of man&#59; we have no right to suppose that
                Joseph was necessarily to be sold for a slave&#44; or that the brothers were
                guiltless in thus maltreating their brother who&#44; though imprudent and blamable
                in bringing evil reports of them to their father&#44; had not offended them beyond
                forgive&#8211; ness. But&#44; as this outrage had been once committed&#44; it was
                turned to a wise account by Providence&#44; and Jacob was drawn to Egypt by the ties
                of love&#44; to see his long&#8211;lost child before his death. &#8212; That Joseph
                suffered for his wrong&#8211;doing was retribution &#59; that Jacob was deprived of
                him for his at first unfounded preference was retribution &#59; so also the remorse
                which the brothers felt was a punishment they richly merited&#59; but for all this
                the Lord moulded the whole transaction to become the mighty lever for the ac&#8211;
                complishment of a great and universal good. Let us now return to our text. The
                Israelites had been redeemed a little more than one year from Egypt&#44; and they
                had arrived at Paran in full march for the conquest of Palestine. But they were
                unused to war&#59; not one of them that had ever seen the land whither they were
                journeying&#59; they were unac&#8211; quainted with the manners of the people&#44;
                their mili&#8211; tary preparations&#44; the soil&#44; cliniate and productions qf
                their future home. &#34;What was then more natural than that they should desire to
                send out some of their chiefs to survey Palestine carefully&#44; and bring them back
                a correct account of all that could interest <pb n="166"/> 166 PROVIDENCE IN

                all their wealth&#44; which&#44; as yet in the East&#44; consisted of herds and
                flocks. Moses no doubt consulted the Lord&#44; who was always ready to speak to him
                when the welfare of the people required the Spirit to descend on the chosen
                people&#44; and the consent was given&#44; that nat&#8211; ural means might be
                resorted to&#44; to arrive at results perfectly legitimate and reasonable in their
                tendency. &#39;No good result was promised to arise therefrom &#59; be&#8211; cause
                man must do his own&#44; and leave the remainder to Providence. Had the
                messengers&#44; who&#44; from their rank&#44; may have been supposed to be beyond
                the sus&#8211; picion of falsehood&#44; executed simply their mission&#44; and
                reported no more than what they had seen&#44; and left the people to draw their own
                inferences from the facts and the specimens of the products of the coun&#8211; try
                which were presented to them&#44; all would have been well&#59; for then the whole
                nation would have been eager to press forward to go and take possession of a lovely
                country&#44; so full of all that could make life pass pleasantly. But most
                unaccountably they brought back a false report of what they had seen&#44; and even
                the gigantic fruit they carried with them to the camp tended to confirm their

                to most of them &#59; the lash of the taskmaster had not been obliterated as yet
                from their lacerated limbs &#59; the sub&#8211; jection to the refined race of Egypt
                had lasted for more than two centuries&#44; and hence the feelings of freemen&#44;
                who would sooner perish than be slaves&#44; had not yet taken sufficient root in
                their heart to resist the inspirations of pusillanimous apprehensions of meeting a
                superior foe used to arms&#44; confident in his strength&#44; and fighting for his
                native soil and his ac&#8211; quired religion. As yet Egypt was to them a model
                nation&#44; the highest in renown for power and intel&#8211; lectual

                restrained their unbridled passions either by new gifts or the strong arm of the

                the pretext for re&#8211; volt&#44; and they already consulted about appointing a
                new chief who should lead them back to peaceful Egypt&#44; preferring as they did
                inglorious servitude to a brilliant death on the field of strife. But this re&#8211;

                had thus proved that they were not fit as yet to enter Palestine&#44; where the

                be so gradually&#44; that the younger members should never lose the paternal care of

                reflect prop&#8211; erly on it&#44; we shall characterize it truly as one of the
                greatest mental phenomena ever witnessed on the earth. Thus did the providence of
                the Lord control the evil which was committed&#44; and the defection which was
                contemplated was made to produce the most lasting good for us and all mankind&#59;

                from the king of the Emorites to defeat him in a battle which his aggression had

                invading army which had been sent to punish the Midianites for their treachery in
                aiding the Moabites to mislead the Israelites to sin. The advice therefore which
                Bileam gave must have been in consonance with the event&#44; and it was his malice
                which counselled and the ready compliance of Balak which accomplished the artful

                not be deprived of its followers&#44; either in us or others&#44; through any
                instrumentality of our own. Let us not flatter ourselves in this connexion that our
                indifference to our faith will always continue&#44; and that we shall never care
                about the ultimate result of our misconduct. For in the first place such a
                rea&#8211; son itself is an insufficient one&#44; and cannot by any possibility
                excuse one single act not permitted by the strict letter of the law&#59; and
                secondly&#44; even if wrong could be defended upon the foolish plea that we cared
                nothing about it&#44; it must still be recollected that a time may come when our
                views will change&#44; and we shall regard then as very heinous what we now
                prac&#8211; tise with so much carelessness and self&#8211;complacency. It does not
                follow that&#44; because this day I violate re&#8211; ligion with indifterence&#44;
                the same must be the case all the days of my life. How can I then consistently with
                sound reason place a bar upon my returning to the convictions which I now
                reject&#63; There is many a sin which stands isolated&#44; and demands not a

                exists&#44; the more thoroughly will the bond which unites us to our faith be
                weakened&#44; and a return to righteousness under the law will become more and VOL.

                that the dere&#8211; liction of the Israelites in the time of Bileam was so severely
                punished&#44; and that so strong a seal of the divine disapprobation was set upon
                the attachment to idols superinduced by a love for gentile women. Be&#8211; lieve me
                that our religion would not have so ener&#8211; getically interdicted all
                intercourse of an intimate kind with gentiles&#44; as to prohibit their &#34; food
                and their wine&#44; and their daughters&#44; &#39;&#39; if fidelity to our faith and
                people could have existed alongside of these acts. But as it is evident that we must
                fall beneath the assaults of sensual indulgences partaken of in common with
                others&#44; and that Ave must be cut ofi&#34; from the communion with Israel by

                Israelites the stigma which adheres to them in their fancy as descendants from a
                Jewish stock. Perhaps we may laugh to scorn such impotent enmity&#59; but still they
                will work mischief by their presence among us&#44; and being thus the means of

                told us in fearful whis&#8211; perings&#44; how men were stricken down as in a
                moment&#44; and how conquering armies quailed and fell&#44; in a single night&#44;
                before the irresistible arm of the unseen destroyer. For a time it rankled at that

                cli&#8211; mate&#44; to produce debility and to nourish pestilential vapours.

                climb the per&#8211; pendicular walls of snow&#8211;capped mountains. But if men
                thought after this fashion&#44; they were grievously deceived&#59; for gradually it
                progressed from its native swamps&#44; until it hud overspread all Asia&#44; the

                had cause for thankfulness in a renewed exemption from the plague. From that period
                until lately we had indulged in the vain hope that henceforward we should be spared
                from the rav&#8211; ages of a disease which had already slain its millions on the

                their countries &#8212; idle as had been the exertions of the most skilful
                physicians and naturalists to grapple with it and to conquer it at its tirst

                lately witnessed&#44; and the stoutest hearts now quail when the news of its
                presence in a city is noised abroad &#59; and well may we say&#44; in the words of
                our text&#44; that &#34;when God causeth his sentence of judgment to be heard&#44;
                the earth is af&#8211; frighted and is hushed&#59;&#34; for man feels now his utter

                to&#8211;day is&#44; accordingly&#44; one of the greatest moment&#59; and it is
                necessary that we ponder well on the same&#44; and not suffer it to escape us
                without endeavouring to let it make a lasting impression on our minds&#44; and to
                influence our actions likewise&#44; in the days that are coming. Let us consider.
                Man is so very apt&#44; in the moment of his prosperity and peace&#44; to consider
                himself as something superior&#44; that often calamities are to him the source of
                the greatest blessings&#44; inasmuch as they cause him to reflect on the vanity and
                transitoriness of sublunary possessions&#44; and to fix his eye on that imperishable
                world which opens to us a bright future through the midst of the gloom of the
                portals of death. Ay&#44; death is a gloomy prospect &#59; the bravest of heart&#44;
                the most devout and resigned to bis Maker&#39;s will&#44; may well shudder at the
                reflection that&#44; before many years&#44; the earth will claim her own in his
                frame&#44; and dust will again mingle with the dust&#44; and the light of the eyes
                will be blotted out&#44; and the bram&#44; the seat of so many thoughts and
                aspirations&#44; will&#44; deprived of the principle which set it in motion&#44;
                mingle with the clod of the valley&#44; undistinguishable from other dust which
                surrounds it&#59; and the tongue&#44; which now speaks forth great thoughts and
                daring ideas&#44; will be stilled&#44; and feel no more. And yet&#44; look at the
                vast majority of mankind&#44; and you see them labour for mere worldly things&#44;
                as though they could toil on for&#8211; ever&#59; they heap up riches&#44; as though
                their end would never come&#59; they hunt for pleasure&#44; as though the changing
                year would always And them in the beauty of youth and the strength of manhood. Is
                not this the course of man &#63; But look at him again&#44; and you <pb n="193"/>
                THE PLAGUE. 193 will see that he toiled in vain &#59; the success which first smiled
                on him only deceived him to rush upon an utter destruction &#59; and him that
                confided in his wealth you may often see stripped of what he so greatly coveted and
                so closely guarded&#59; or you will behold the proud beauty speedily changed by
                disease into an object of loathing&#44; or see him who trusted in his manly vigour
                crippled in limb and helplessly deformed. Is not this a picture of life &#63;
                Yet&#44; even let nothing but success&#44; and plenty&#44; and strength&#44; and
                joy&#44; accompany the son of man uninterruptedly from his birth till the highest
                old age&#44; still what will then be the end &#63; Will not the silver cord be

                approaches hourly&#44; momentarily&#59; and each word spoken&#44; each syllable
                uttered&#44; each breath drawn&#44; we have performed a step which brings us nearer
                and nearer to the grave. No grace&#44; no virtue&#44; no wealth&#44; no vigour&#44;
                no beauty&#44; can snatch us from the open gulf which either looms up in the certain
                distance or yawns at our feet&#44; ready to swallow us up in its insatiable jaws.
                All that are born are born to die&#44; all that have life are doomed to the
                grave&#59; and earth&#44; and air&#44; and water&#44; and fire&#44; are pledged to
                carry out the Creator&#39;s will&#59; and thus the end of life is death&#44; and all
                that is bright on earth is sure to be dimmed by the hand which gathers in the rich
                harvest which always ripens for the grave. Were it&#44; therefore&#44; that all men
                would thus reflect&#44; and look upon earth as a place of preparation for an&#8211;
                other world&#44; constant prosperity would not be a bar to their happiness
                hereafter. But tell a man&#44; in the day of his success&#44; to think of the

                for grief to see the unthinking hurrying along on their destructive path&#44;
                notwithstanding that your words bore the lessons of wisdom. But see the worldling
                again&#44; when the sun of his prosperity is clouded&#44; or when disease invades
                his doniicil&#44; which he was fain to imagine inaccessible to the calamities of
                other men&#44; and you may perhaps find him changed in his estimation of his own
                importance&#44; and he may perhaps then listen to the breathings of consolation
                which are found in the words of religion. Yes&#44; when men are brought to tremble
                at the majesty of God &#8212; yes&#44; when nations have learned that prosperity is
                not of their own making&#44; will they bow in submission to Him through whose bounty
                they live&#44; through whose goodness their power is established. It is then that
                they come to search into their conduct&#44; to see whether or not they have not
                deserved the misery under which they suffer &#58; whereas a constant stream of
                success would only have rendered them obdurate&#44; and inspired them with the
                arrogant assurance that their conduct&#44; their entire course&#44; had been
                consonant with the laws of mercy and justice. &#34;When a calamity&#44;
                therefore&#44; befalls us&#44; we should not arraign the Divine Providence for
                injustice&#44; &#8212; not accuse the Merciful One of caprice&#44; of unmindfulness
                of our claims to immunity&#59; but we should at once set <pb n="195"/> THE TLAGUE.
                195 about examining into our own conduct&#44; and seek for tiie source of the evil
                in wliat we have done or omit&#8211; ted. If a man discovers that gradually
                afflictions overtake him&#44; he should immediately look over care&#8211; fully in
                what he has failed&#44; see whether or not his heart has become proud and
                rebellions&#44; whether he is yet as entire with his God as he was wont to be. If he
                then discerns the sin of pride lurking within&#44; if he beholds the demon of
                covetousness preying on his vitals&#44; if he detects the spirit of unbelief
                springing up in his soul&#44; or if he is made conscious that he has not at any time
                served his God with the true&#44; entire devo&#8211; tion which the Scriptures
                demand of him&#58; he should unhesitatingly condemn himself&#44; and accept the
                pun&#8211; ishment as a wise chastisement sent to recall him from earth to heaven.
                He should accordingly stifle the arrogance of pride&#44; though it be but in an
                incipient state&#44; for only then is it conquerable&#44; before yet the contempt of
                our species&#44; and the inordinate exaltation of self have degenerated into a
                passion. He should overcome by all possible elibrts the undue desire for worldly
                possessions&#59; he should apply himself with humble prayer to the study of the word
                of God&#44; so as to conquer the tendency to skepticism which he has discovered&#59;
                and lastly&#44; he should make the practice of religion a daily exercise&#44; and
                contemplate at every hour of the day&#44; at any employment in which he may be
                engaged&#44; the goodness and mercy of God&#44; how He bestows so many benefits on
                his creatures&#44; blessing the undeserving even&#44; and not withholding all good
                from every generation&#44; whether they be virtuous or forgetful of His laws. And
                should&#44; after all&#44; the cal&#8211; amity not be removed&#44; let him not omit
                persevering in &#8211; <pb n="196"/> 196 THE PLAGUE. his altered righteous
                course&#59; for he may be sure that the evil is calculated I&#39;or his mental
                elevation&#44; inas&#8211; much as a renewed prosperity might withdraw him again
                from the path of repentance on which he has just commenced to enter&#44; But we know
                from experi&#8211; ence that to the righteoits a light always springs from
                darkness&#44; and that in bearing the evils which beset them in a manner becoming
                those who love their God&#44; and confide in Ilim in resigned meekness&#44; they set
                a beautiful example to the world of the superior efficacy of a pursuit of
                religion&#44; and they confer a benefit on all by proving that man needs but little
                to enable him to live in cheerful content&#44; and that even amidst bodily ailments
                he can glorify his Maker&#44; provided only that he places his trust in Him who
                never de&#8211; ceives&#44; and whose spirit always is with the afflicted&#44; to
                aid them in tlieir struggle with the adversities of life. It is thus that what we
                call evil is calculated to rivet closer the union which connects the creature with
                the Creator&#44; and is thus fitted to stimulate him to persevere in doing what he
                is taught to be right&#44; or to return to it&#44; in case he should have acted
                con&#8211; trary to its dictates. The individual&#44; moreover&#44; can easily scan
                his whole conduct&#44; if he has independence enough to judge himself without
                favour&#44; and if he is sufficiently alive to the dictates of duty which re&#8211;
                vealed religion asks of liim &#59; wherefore every admo&#8211; nition he
                receives&#44; whether it be through words of advice or unforeseen affliction&#44;
                can be properly re&#8211; ceived as an incentive to an amendment of conduct&#59; in
                consequence of which he can be at once licld amen&#8211; able if he refuses to
                listen&#44; and he may therefore not complain of injustice if the chastening hand is

                state. Nations also often sin nationally&#59; that is to say&#44; they are guilty of
                collective wrongs&#44; for which the whole body politic becomes liable to divine
                visitation&#44; Now the Almighty has appointed three prominent agents to chastise
                whole communities&#44; and they have ever proved the scourge of erring man&#44;
                afflicting per&#8211; haps not all&#44; but an indefinite number of the
                inhabi&#8211; tants of one or more countries. I speak of war&#44; famine&#44; and
                pestilence&#44; which slay their thousands without destroying&#44; except under rare
                circumstances&#44; entire communities. But this emphatically proves that a
                Providence regulates the evils&#44; especially those which proceed on their mission
                without human inter&#8211; vention. Were it that the pestilence&#44; for
                instance&#44; should sweep off the population of an entire district&#44; it might be
                ascribed to some unknown change in the atmosphere&#44; to some organic modification
                which is hostile to human life. But all the researches of phi&#8211; losophers have
                hitherto utterly failed to prove&#44; that such a change or modification of the
                atmospheric air which we breathe is the cause of the difterent pesti&#8211; lences
                which have ravaged the earth at various times&#59; and they have at length&#44;
                though reluctantly&#44; been compelled to acknowledge the mysterious agency of a
                divine visitation. The sky is often clear&#44; without a spot on the beautiful blue
                vault which is spread like a tent over us&#59; the sun shines with a brilliant
                clear&#8211; ness&#59; a pleasant breeze is wafted over the earth and sea&#59; a
                teeming mantle of green covers with a luxu&#8211; riant growth the field and
                meadow&#59; &#8212; and yet each breath drawn in such a sky&#44; in such a
                season&#44; is 17&#42; <pb n="198"/> 198 THE PLAGUE. fraught with death.
                &#33;Nevertheless&#44; all do not die&#44; ex&#8211; posed though they be to the
                same influences&#44; breath&#8211; ing as they do the same death&#8211;loaded
                atmosx>here&#59; and often the robust and healthy sink rapidly before the
                destroyer&#44; whilst the decrepit and the diseased survive&#44; and perform the
                last sad rites to those who vainly imagined that they would outlive the others. What
                does all this teach&#44; but that the pestilence obeys the laws of its Sender&#44;
                that fei the midst of its ravages not one is stricken down on whom is inscribed the
                sign of life&#63; I would not thereby&#39; convey the idea that it is vain to
                observe rules of prudence in epi&#8211; demic visitations as useless. Far from
                it&#59; we must use all the precautions and remedies which experience has
                recommended as useful&#59; but I would only show that&#44; with all human care and
                foresight&#44; which we justly employ as agents placed within our reach by
                Providence&#44; we at length are dependent on Him only for the success of all
                remedial agents &#59; inasmuch as so many fall who are well fortified&#44; whilst
                those are spared who are weak and exposed. In short&#44; the whole course of history
                proves that no one can account for the various inflictions of evil which
                occasionally visit the earth. All cares cannot ward ofl&#58;&#39; the plague&#44; if
                God bids it to go forth. No one can arrest the famine&#44; if the decree from above
                sends blight and disease on the fruits of man&#39;s labour. No counsels of the wise
                can altogether prevent the calamities of war&#44; even now&#44; in this enlightened
                age&#44; when so great a progress has been made in the con&#8211; struction of
                deadly engines&#44; which renders the contest of nations so much more bloody now
                than it was ever before&#44; though immense slaughters have signalized <pb n="199"/>
                THE PLAGUE. 199 the ages of darkness no less than the present. All human foresight
                is in vain to ward off the instru&#8211; ments of vengeance which the Lord holds in
                his hands&#59; and let&#44; therefore&#44; no nation&#44; no matter how mighty and
                enlightened&#44; pass heedlessly by&#44; when either of the great national
                calamities befall it or its neighbours. V ictory itself is but a slight recompense
                for the calamities of war&#59; a rich return for a super&#8211; abundant harvest at
                home cannot compensate the feeling heart for the sufferings which scarcity of food
                occasions in other lands&#59; and the exemption from bodily ailment is no source of
                exultation&#44; when we see the grave closing hour after hour upon those we value
                and hold dear. When Moses now&#44; in addressing the Israelites as a nation&#44; and
                in this capacity only was the law govern&#8211; ing their commonwealth imparted to
                them&#44; indepen&#8211; dently of those ordinances which concern the indi&#8211;

                promised them exemption from war&#44; famine&#44; and unusual mortality.
                Concern&#8211; ing war&#44; he said &#58; &#34; If you will walk in my statutes&#44;
                then will I give peace in the land&#44; and you shall lie down&#44; and none shall
                make you afraid.&#34; &#40;Levit. xxvi. 6.&#41; Concerning plenty&#44; he said&#58;
                &#34;And I Avill give your rains in their season&#44; and the earth shall yield her
                increase&#44; and the tree of the Held shall give its fruit. And the threshing
                season shall reach with you the vintage&#44; and the vintage shall last until

                shall dwell securely in your land.&#34; &#40;Ibid. 4&#44; 5.&#41; Likewise in Deut.
                xi. 14&#44; is the same idea repeated&#58; &#34; And I will give the rain of your

                Besides these&#44; there are several other passages&#44; which it is needless to
                quote at present&#44; as what has hcen given is sutii&#8211; cient for our purpose.
                And lastly&#44; concerning sick&#8211; ness&#44; he says&#58; &#34;If thou wilt
                hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God&#44; and wilt do what is just in his
                eyes&#44; and listen to his commandments&#44; and observe all his statutes&#44;
                every sickness which I have inflicted on Egypt I will not inflict on thee&#59; for I
                am the Lord&#44; thy physician.&#34; &#40;Exod. xv. 26.&#41; So also&#44; &#34;I
                will fulfil the number of thy days &#34; &#40;Ibid&#44; xxiii. 26&#41;&#44; Avhich
                re&#8211; fers also to the verse immediately preceding&#44; which is in these
                words&#58; &#34; If ye serve the Lord your God&#44; then will he bless thy bread and
                thy water&#44; and I will remove sickness from the midst of thee.&#34; For the
                present we must be satisfied with these few extracts&#44; which indicate in what
                manner Moses applied the blessings for obedience to the nation. He spoke to them
                collectively&#44; not individually&#59; wherefore he set before them national
                blessings&#44; such as peace&#44; plenty&#44; and health&#59; for spiritual
                excellencies in a future state cannot aftect nations collectively&#44; since they
                are only imaginable in a bodily existence&#44; as we are on this earth of ours.
                So&#44; on the other side&#44; the condemna&#8211; tion of the soul of the sinner
                cannot have any terror for entire communities&#44; for the same reason&#59;
                where&#8211; fore Moses threatened war&#44; famine&#44; and pestilence to aftect the
                Israelites nationally&#44; in case they&#44; as a na&#8211; tion&#44; would rebel
                against the Lord&#44; whilst he handed over the individual malefactor to the
                vengeance of the outraged laws of the commonwealth. I refer yo4i to chapter xxvi. of
                Leviticus&#44; and xxviii. and xxxii. of <pb n="201"/> THE PLAGUE. 201
                Deuteronomy&#44; for the effects of a national backslid&#8211; ing. I have detained
                you already so much to&#8211;day&#44; that I will omit the passages which specially
                bear on our subject&#44; satisfied as I am that you will readily sup&#8211; ply the
                deficiencies by a simple reference to your Bibles. Understand&#44; however&#44; that
                though spiritual punishments and rewards are not laid down in so many words&#44;
                they are nevertheless plainly alluded to in various passages&#44; especially in
                Levit. xxvi. 11&#44; 12&#44; for the rewards&#44; and verse 30 for the punishments.
                But enough for our present purpose that we have established by Scriptural authority
                that the recur&#8211; rence of every national calamity ought to induce us to seek
                for the cause in some wrong in which the na&#8211; tion which is especially
                afflicted&#44; or the whole mass of mankind&#44; may be collectively concerned. We
                may also assert that a general system of oppression&#44; fraud&#44;
                licentiousness&#44; or profanity&#44; is a national or general wrong&#44;
                sufficiently great to bring down one of the calamities which afflict the world. It
                were easy enough to prove&#44; by actual reference to the history of the present
                age&#44; that it is not a whit better than its predecessors in oppression and wrong
                inflicted by the stronger on the weaker party. There are occa&#8211; sionally
                glimpses of sunshine&#44; which would lead one to suppose that a better era was
                approaching&#58; when&#44; alas &#33; the illusion is soon and painfully dissipated
                by the recurrence of some terrible outburst of violence and bloodshed&#44; by a
                wholesale slaughter of tens of thousands&#44; in the streets&#44; perhaps&#44; of
                some quiet city&#44; and by other acts of cruel barbarity&#44; wdiich have
                dis&#8211; figured the history of the last few months. I will concede that
                refinement has progressed&#44; that the arts <pb n="202"/> 202 THE PLAGUE. and
                sciences have advanced to a height formerly un&#8211; known &#59; but these are
                national blessings&#44; not national virtues&#44; and ought to have excited the
                gratitude of mankind toward their Benefactor&#59; whereas in fact they have presumed
                on their gifts to question not rarely the providence of Him by whose bounty they
                were blessed. Do you therefore wonder that the earth has been visited with dreadful
                disasters &#63; &#8212; that blow is struck on blow &#63; &#8212; and that one
                visitation closely follows on the other&#63; Happy indeed will it therefore be&#44;
                if the present calamity induces the masses to think&#44; and to cause them to lay
                aside strife&#44; injustice&#44; and oppression towards each other&#44; and a
                rebellious in&#8211; gratitude to God. In this all men may be guilty or
                meritorious&#44; as the case may be &#59; and herein all can participate&#44;
                notwithstanding their diiference in per&#8211; suasion&#44; or conviction on
                theoretical religion. All civilized men acknowledge but the self&#8211;same code of
                morals&#44; and by that must they be judged&#44; and by this same standard must they
                collectively and individually probe themselves. We see how for the last tilty years
                one evil has followed on the other&#59; we also see that but little progress has
                been made in the moral im&#8211; provement of man. On the contrary&#44; we are
                com&#8211; pelled to acknowledge that in simplicity and truth there has been a great
                and woful falling oft&#39; from a his&#59;&#33;&#33; standard. Is it then not time
                that each man search in his own heart for any latent evil which he may cherish
                there&#63; Nations are but collections of individuals &#59; nations must repent&#44;
                therefore&#44; through their individuals&#59; wherefore each one is called upon to

                how much more is it requisite for us to re&#8211; turn to the good old standard of
                religious conformity&#44; to the simplicity of that faith which characterized our
                predecessors. Much as we may value the progress of free and liberal opinions&#44; we
                must also deplore the decay of that high&#8211;souled devotion which caused the
                oppressed Ilebrew of former years to Und in his faith a home which his country
                denied him&#44; a hope which nothing could quench&#44; and an abiding trust which
                nothing could shake. But now&#44; &#8212; what are we &#63; Worldlings&#44; seekers
                after pleasure and gain&#44; anxious for a name on earth&#44; though our inheritance

                that truth compels us to acknowledge this guilt. And who knows but that through our
                misdeeds in part is this evil brought upon the world &#63; Wherefore it is time that
                we arouse ourselves&#44; in common with the other inhabitants of the country. Let
                them follow their convictions &#59; let them go each in the light they have received
                &#59; but lot us go in the name of the living God&#44; the everlasting King&#44; who
                gave us His law to observe as an ever&#8211;enduring covenant. But let all&#44; not
                excepting ourselves&#39;&#44; take heed that they do not add the sin of national
                hypocrisy to their other trans&#8211; gressions&#59; and let them not assemble this
                day merely to show themselves penitent&#44; without feeling sincerely that they have
                transgressed. The mere observance of any day is nothing&#44; but it is the spirit
                alone which sanctifies the act&#59; and so we are taught in Joel ii. 12&#44; 13
                &#58; &#34; And now&#44; also saith the Lord&#44; lieturn unto me with all your
                heart&#44; and with fasting&#44; and weeping&#44; and mourning&#44; and rend your

                merciful&#44; long&#8211;suflering and great in kindness&#44; and repentant of the
                evil.&#34; Let us act thus&#44; and be resolved henceforward to obey the commands of
                the Lord&#44; and there may be hope that He will ar&#8211; rest the destroyer&#44;

                DISCOURSE XV. OUR RELATION TO GOD. O God of mercy &#33; by thy goodness we have been
                spared amidst the ravages of the pestilence&#44; and we stand at the conclusion of
                another year&#44; and the chang&#8211; ing season proclaims that another summer is
                gone&#59; and thy faithful children again prepare themselves to declare anew their
                devotion to thy rule&#44; and they will hail Thee once more as the King of all the
                earth. O Father&#33; listen to the joyful shout which will soon be heard throughout
                all Israel&#44; to the united voice which will ascend to thy throne &#59; hear thy
                people when they acknowledge thy omnipotence&#44; and hearken when they call on Thee
                to remember them unto life and happiness&#44; and write them in the book of
                salvation&#44; for the sake of thy holy Name&#44; and forgive and pardon their
                iniquities&#44; because the abundance of mercy is with Thee. Amen. <pb n="205"/> our

                at the brink of the departing year&#44; it is proper that we should dwell&#44; for a
                brief space&#44; with earnest words and thoughts on the contemplation which each
                change of the seasons awakes in the heart of man&#44; if he thinks at all on the
                events which pass unceasingly under his observation. There are indeed many who
                travel through life apparently without any serious thought&#59; to them it is all in
                all that they pursue their business successfully&#59; that they enjoy the good
                things of life&#59; that their wives and children make a good appearance before
                man&#59; but when their impulses have been gratified at such a result&#44; they are
                careless about the past&#44; thoughtless of the future&#59; they know from the
                experience of others that men are mortal &#58; yet in their own persons they seem to
                forget that there is an end to the prosjrrerity they enjoy and to the good things
                which they consume&#44; a limit to the fine ap&#8211; pointments&#44; furniture and
                equipages which distin&#8211; guish their families from the common masses who have
                to dispense with the luxuries which they possess in abundance. Or there are others
                who waste their time in idle dissipation&#44; who love to grovel in thÂ§ dust&#44;
                to have coarse appetites and brutal desires&#44; who deform the human face divine by
                deeds of debauchery&#44; and bloat it by drunkenness. These too rush through their
                brief space of years&#44; as though the earth were their home&#44; as though they
                had no occasion for higher aspirations&#44; for nobler acts than mere carnal
                gratifi&#8211; cation &#58; yet they too will be brought to their end&#44; and the
                earth will be heaped over their head&#44; and on their body will feed the grass and

                the exclusive objects of our regard and care&#44; and that we duly appreciate the
                uncertainty of life which admonishes us momen&#8211; tarily to prepare for the
                change of time for eternity which is impending over all men. Yea&#44; let season
                glide by season&#44; let year follow on year&#44; and let each find us in joy and
                happiness&#44; in health and vigour&#44; let our house stand unshaken&#44; and our
                friends be all around us for another and yet another revolution of the moon&#44; and
                then say&#44; is it all safe &#63; is all secure against the overthrow of the
                structure of clay in which our soul dwells&#63; You may say&#44; These are trite
                remarks&#44; they are constantly addressed to us by all sorts of moral writers&#44;
                by preachers of all per&#8211; suasions. You are right&#44; these remarks are not
                new with any one of the present generation &#59; men in ages long past&#44; perhaps
                from the very beginning of the presence of man in society&#44; have said this&#44;
                and ex&#8211; horted their hearers to reflect on their mortality. But vliilst human
                passions are the same&#44; whilst mankind will lunuy blindly and wilfully upon
                destruction&#44; it becomes those who have been appointed watchmen among their
                fellows to sound the alarm&#44; and to repeat aii&#39;ain and again in the cars of
                their hearers&#44; &#34; Remeni&#8211; ber that you are mortal &#33; remember that
                you are ac&#8211; countable.&#34; Ay&#44; men will hear the words&#44; and pass on
                as though they heard them not&#59; they will close their ears to the advice which
                religion proffers them&#44; and live forgetful of their spiritual welfare&#44;
                despite <pb n="207"/> OUR RELATION TO GOD. 207 of the repeated admonition. All is to
                them a thrice&#8211; told tale&#44; something over which they may make themselves
                merry&#44; or fall asleep&#44; as the humour may counsel them. But what of that
                &#63; has the moralist therefore nothing to do &#63; is he to remain silent
                he&#8211; cause his should&#8211;be hearers are deaf&#63; Imaa&#59;ine be&#8211;
                fore you a city asleep in the dead of night&#44; and let the wakeful watchman
                perceive a fire enkindled by the hand of the incendiary&#44; in the midst of a
                crowded neighbourhood&#44; where slumber thousands of uncon&#8211; scious
                dreamers&#44; where are buried in repose the ten&#8211; der wife and the helpless
                children. What should the watchman do &#63; Yea&#44; sound the alarm &#59; he should
                cry &#34;Fire&#44; lire&#33;&#34; and if he fails to rouse the sleepers at once&#44;
                he should redouble his cry till some one hears him&#44; and then he should repair to
                the tocsin to toll in loud and admonishing sounds to rouse all to exertion&#44; not
                alone those wdio are in danger&#44; but all others&#44; even the remotest&#44; for
                fear of the conflagration&#39;s spreading&#44; and that all may be ready to stop the
                de&#8211; vouring element from endangering the portion that is yet free from the
                flames. No one will blame the guardian of the night for having created a useless
                alarm&#44; for having waked up too many sleepers&#44; al&#8211; though the danger
                was actually magnified by his fears&#44; althouijh the flames were subdued bv the
                exertion of a few&#44; with a limited number of buckets of water. You willingly
                forgive him&#44; should he repeat a similar offence &#59; for you would correctly
                say. Far better is it that we be aroused before the danger is imminent&#44; than
                that our nightly guardian should permit us to sleep at a moment when danger actually
                threatens. Even so&#44; brethren&#44; is the case with your moral guar&#8211; <pb

                tell you &#34; what is of the night&#44; &#34; to let you know how it is with your
                moral horizon&#44; whether there he symptoms of fire or of any other danger in the
                farthest distance&#44; that they may arouse you betimes&#44; that they may sound ihe
                tocsin&#44; so that you may bo able to escape. As a watchman therefore among
                you&#44; I stand here to warn you of the wrath that is coming&#44; in case you lead
                the life of ungodliness&#44; and follow the evil de&#8211; sires of your heart to
                forsake the law of the Lord your God which He commanded to your fVithers. It is no
                idle threat which your religion utters against the workers of iniquity&#59; for
                amply has she been avenged&#8211; on us especially&#44; not to mention other
                na&#8211; tions of the earth&#44; because we would not listen to her voice. We
                contemned her counsels&#44; we derided her &#8211;words &#59; and she fled to heaven
                to appeal for redress against our forgetfulness of our duty&#44; and fearfully has
                her cause been avenged&#44; and we arc this day the standing evidence how fearfully
                those suffer who neg&#8211; lect their God in pursuing earthly toils and carnal
                pleasures. Our fathers were fully as refined as we are &#59; Jerusalem was fall of
                beauty and elegance&#44; than which nothing is more excellent in this our boasted
                age of refinement &#59; literature flourished to a degree which we have not yet
                reached since then &#59; agricul&#8211; ture stood on a height from which it is
                sadly fallen&#59; our sons were brave&#44; our cities were strong&#44; and
                com&#8211; merce and navigation poured their rich treasures into the havens of the
                sea which belonged to our land. No one believed that the oppressor and enemy would
                ever stand in thy gates&#44; O Jerusalem&#33; and still he came with his
                legions&#44; as numerous as the locusts that <pb n="209"/> OUR RELATION TO GOD. 209
                devour the herbage of the field&#44; and he uprooted thy walls&#44; he cast down thy
                temple&#44; he overthrew thy altars&#44; he burnt thy palaces with fire&#44; and
                those of thy children whom the sword&#44; the famine and the pesti&#8211; lence had
                spared&#44; he led forth into captivity&#44; and scat&#8211; tered them over all the
                face of the earth&#44; as the farmer casts his seed over the furrows of the field
                which he has ploughed for a future harvest. And this was done &#8212; not out of
                revenge &#8212; not out of malevolence &#8212; not out of hatred from the Divine
                Master to us his people &#8212; his people though we had rebelled &#8212; but that
                we might be recalled to ourselves in the hour of tribulation&#44; that we might be
                snatched from the path of corruption&#44; that our blessed religion might be saved
                to the world&#44; while she was in danger of perishing in our prosperity through the
                great backsliding which was witnessed whilst we lived at peace and united in our own
                land. We had been made the bearers of God&#39;s covenant&#59; and when we showed
                that we preferred the ways of the world to the parth of righteousness&#44; the
                bridle of dis&#8211; tress was put in our mouths&#44; and the unseen hand of God
                guided us back to the path from which we had strayed. For Israel had entered into a
                covenant with the Lord to be his witnesses on earth&#44; which task was to be
                accomplished by their being mindful of his in&#8211; struction &#59; prosperity&#44;
                national and individual&#44; should be the reward of a w&#39;illingness to obey&#59;
                and on the contrary the dark waters of sorrow should open as a deep chasm at their
                feet in case they should desire to become like the nations of the earth&#44; to
                worship stocks and stones&#44; and to pray to a god who cannot save. Literally a
                yawning gulf should bar our way&#44; should warn us to retrace our steps to the safe
                haven 18&#42; <pb n="210"/> 210 OUR RELATION TO GOD. of the divine mercy&#58; and so
                it happened. For no sooner were we carried away to Babylon&#44; than idol&#8211;
                atry was forever banished from the heart of Israelites&#59; no sooner had our temple
                tallen a prey to the flames&#44; lit up by the tierce legionaries of the proud&#44;
                conquer&#8211; ing Roman&#44; who overcame us because of the discord that reigned in
                our councils&#44; and because of the civil strife that raged in the streets of
                Jerusalem&#44; than we swore anew fealty to our faith&#44; and declared by the lurid
                glow that overwhelmed our sanctuary&#44; that now our mission had fairly
                commenced&#44; and that we would carry our laws&#44; our language&#44; our
                uncontami&#8211; nated lineage whithersoever the winds of heaven might drive our
                storm&#8211;tossed bark. Have we kept our vow &#63; have we remained faithful to our
                mission &#63; Let history speak&#44; let it defend Providence against the false
                accusation of those who love not our religion&#44; when they say that we are cast
                off from grace and forsaken &#59; for never could we have survived the trib&#8211;
                ulations&#44; the more than fiery trials which we encoun&#8211; tered in our
                wanderings&#44; had God not been with us &#39;7N uo&#59;&#63;&#39;&#39;&#63;i&#39;7.
                &#8212; God was indeed with us&#44; and whenever we were afflicted He stood by our
                side to watch that not too great were our trials&#44; that not too heavily rested on
                us the burden of sorrow. We suffered &#59; but we felt that it was well for us that
                we were af&#8211; flicted&#44; so that we might turn aside from the world&#44; and
                search in the law of our God &#59; we felt that at each recurrence of tribulation we
                were again drawn nearer into the embrace of the benevolent Father&#44; from whom
                prosperity had at times well&#8211;nigh severed us&#44; and induced us to slacken
                our vigilance&#44; and to adopt the manners of the nations of the eartli&#44; as <pb
                    n="211"/> OUR RELATION TO GOD. 211 though our constant care were no longer
                needed in the enlargement which had been granted to us. And was this clinging to our
                faith in vain&#63; was it an idle thing for which we have striven&#44; and
                wandered&#44; and suflered&#44; and bled &#63; No&#44; no&#33; let nations boast of
                their victories&#44; of their march of improvement&#44; of their beautiful
                capitals&#44; of their numerous armies&#59; but give us our religion&#44; our ruined
                Jerusalem&#44; our wasted temple&#44; the recollection of our ancient fame&#59; for
                they are enough to make us glory in our descent&#44; and to give us pleasure in
                being assured that indeed the Lord&#44; and He alone&#44; is our God. No lapse of
                cen&#8211; turies can make any change in this inheritance &#59; no distance of
                climate can rob a son of Israel of the least of his birthright&#59; but
                whenever&#44; wherever&#44; and whatever he is&#44; he remains a child of the
                covenant&#44; a participator in the promised reward and redemption at the hand of
                his Maker. With these views let us examine the words of Moses in his last address to
                the people&#44; just on the eve of his departure from earthly life &#58; &#34; And
                not with you alone do I make this covenant&#44; and this oath of confirmation &#59;
                but with him who is standing with us here this day before the Lord our God&#44; and
                with him who is not with us here this day.&#34; Deut. xxix. 13&#44; 14. You will
                recollect that Moses spoke altogether of the future &#59; since with him the days of
                sublunary life <pb n="212"/> 212 OUR RELATION TO GOD. were soon to terminate. All
                the blessings he pro&#8211; posed&#44; all the curses which he pronounced were to be
                realized immediately or long after his death. lie fixed no limit as to the time when
                the blessings were to cease&#44; and spoke of no termination for the liability to
                the curses. Just as the religion was experienced in his own age&#44; did he transmit
                it to future ages&#44; with all its obligations and duties&#44; and their attendant
                re&#8211; wards and punishments. There was no hesitation or ambiguity in his words
                &#59; no subterfuges&#44; no limitations&#44; no exceptions&#59; he spoke for all
                classes&#44; for all times and all circumstances&#59; and if anything were necessary
                to prove the divine legation of Moses&#44; it could be found in the universality and
                ubiquity of the application of his precepts to the circumstances of the people for
                whom primarily his legislation was intended. The re&#8211; sult too of his
                predictions&#44; as regards the consequence of compliance or
                non&#8211;compliance&#44; has been precisely&#39; what he declared they should
                be&#44; whilst he yet dwelt among us. All has been accomplished according to the

                defending them by adapt&#8211; ing a sense to them which only cunning interpreters
                might discover. So there is also in our text no dou&#8211; ble meaning&#44; and it
                simply says&#44; that Closes&#44; in the covenant or agreement with the people&#44;

                but with all those similarly situated who might be born at a later&#44; nay the
                latest&#44; period. Again you can discover no limitation as to time and place&#59;

                heaven&#44; and the Israelites&#44; his chosen witnesses on earth. What does this
                say&#63; is it that a time will come under the Mosaic dispensa&#8211; tion that the
                observance of the ceremonies is to cease &#63; or that all which the Lord has
                commanded is to re&#8211; main unchanged till such a period&#44; grant even that it

                &#63; Understand&#44; there is a material difference between a precept dead of
                itself by lapse of time or change of circumstance&#44; and one repealed by the
                express authority of the one or the collective body who first enacted it &#58; in
                the one case any person may pronounce on its nullity&#44; in the other no one but
                the enacting authority. But if we examine our ques&#8211; tion by the light which
                revelation&#44; history and com&#8211; mon sense throw on it&#44; we cannot discover
                a single repealing clause&#44; either direct or by implication&#44; re&#8211;
                specting any law of Moses&#44; except it be those precepts referring directly to
                especial circumstances&#44; the repe&#8211; tition of which becomes impossible after
                a certain period&#44; for instance&#44; the mode of slaying the Passover&#8211; lamb
                as practised in Egypt&#44; which was practicable only in that manner at tlie
                particular time and place in question&#44; namely the night of the Exodus&#44; or
                which are bound to certain localities or periods&#44; and there&#8211; fore of no
                effect if the people are differently circum&#8211; stanced from the particular
                position as contemplated in their code. In all such cases we may say that the laws
                bear within themselves their own repeal or limi&#8211; tation&#59; and having
                fulfilled the object of their insti&#8211; <pb n="214"/> 214 OUR RELATION TO GOD.
                tution&#44; they become from that moment of no farther binding force&#44; till a new
                relation springs up&#44; when their applicability becomes of new significance. To
                the latter class I would refer the laws relating to the priesthood and the
                sacrifices. They were intimately bound up with the Israelites&#39; possessing
                Palestine and their having a temple as the chosen residence of God&#44; With the
                destruction of the house of God and the expulsion of the people from Palestine
                ceased&#44; therefore&#44; all the regulations connected with the scheme of
                sacrifice and the active duties of the priests and Levitcs&#59; because the manner
                of acting in these respects as pointed out in the code had ceased to ex&#8211; ist.
                But the sanctity of the sons of Aaron&#44; and their selection to bless the people
                as commanded&#44; have not terminated&#59; because these matters were not connected
                with the circumstances just named. So soon how&#8211; ever as the temple is again
                restored&#44; and the people are again settled in their ancient boundaries&#44;
                there appears not a single warrant in the law&#44; as it is now in our
                possession&#44; to authorize any one to say that sacrifices and priesthood have been
                abolished. It may be possible that God designates a new state of things at the time
                of the promised restoration &#59; but the plain letter of prophecy does not teach
                it&#59; and we have no means other than this to arrive at a knowledire of what the
                Lord intends to decree. Sacri&#8211; ficcs however will be restored&#44; to judge
                from this standard&#44; and again shall the priests officiate in the courts
                consecrated to our God&#44; and incense will again ascend on high as a sweet savour
                to the Lord of life. What I mean to exhibit by the views I have just presented is
                this&#44; that all the precepts of our religion <pb n="215"/> OUR RELATION TO GOD.
                215 are as binding now as ever they were&#44; since no au&#8211; thority has been
                conferred on ns to pronounce on their nullity. When you hear therefore that the
                progress of enlightenment has absolved you from the observances of any
                commandment&#59; when any one tells you that there is a dift&#39;erence in holiness
                between a moral enactment and a religious ordinance &#58; reject the assertion in
                both instances as unsound and un&#8211; scriptural &#59; I will not say
                unrabbinical&#44; for the evi&#8211; dent letter of the Bible speaks of the
                permanence of all the ordinances&#44; and it is only by implication that we assume
                at all that any repeal can take place&#44; upon the supposition that He who thought
                proper to bid us act as it is written&#44; may at some future period think fit to
                absolve us from the farther observance of cere&#8211; monies&#59; but there is no
                proof from the prophets that this will ever be. At all events we know as yet of no
                authoritative repeal &#59; wherefore inference cannot per&#8211; mit us to sit in
                judgment upon the books of Moses&#44; and to accept and reject&#44; just as it may
                suit our fancy and our ideas of what is or is not consonant with the progress of the
                age and the march of intellect. For let us see what does Moses enforce in the
                twenty&#8211; ninth chapter of Deuteronomy&#44; from which our text is a part&#63;
                Simply the observance of all that is written in the book of the law &#59; as he says
                in verse 20 &#58; &#34; The secret things belong to the Lord our God&#59; but the
                revealed ones are for us and our children forever&#44; to observe all the words of
                this law.&#34; I know not where words more clear and emphatic can be found in the
                whole range of written language &#59; hence it arises that all those who entered
                into tlie covenant to be God&#39;s people&#44; that is&#44; the Israelites and

                moral laws and rules affecting civil government&#44; or those relating merely to our
                observance of religious ordinances &#59; since all are comprised in the revealed

                allegiance to your God&#44; which your fathers pledged themselves to on the day of
                the assembly at Iloreb. It is not a small thing your fathers promised &#59; they
                looked into the dark future and saw thousands of generations rising one by one from
                their loins&#44; and encompassing the whole with a prophetic view they gave a
                promise of obedience for themselves and all their sons in all futurity. And you&#44;

                the foundation of Judaism&#44; &#8212; yes&#44; much as has been said of the

                man&#8211; kind continue to forget the laws of God&#44; it is but proper that they
                should be reminded that they ought to retrieve their moral delinquency&#59; simply
                because God gave them the power and the means to accom&#8211; plish this task&#44;
                and that a refusal to repent is an ad&#8211; dition to their already heavy burden of
                iniquity. Whatever may be said of other religions about the beauty of their
                doctrines&#44; and the assuaging power they have to calm the disturbed mind and to
                lift it up from the slough of despondence and despair&#58; Judaism knows no superior
                in these essential elements of men&#8211; tal purification. It is true that it
                enjoins duties and obligations&#44; the neglect or transgression of which will draw
                down on the offender the punishment denounced in the Bible against sinners&#59; but
                this does not prove that it must therefore fail to bring peace to the in&#8211; ward
                man in a less degree than is accomplished by a system which enjoins no duties&#44;
                Avhich causes all sal&#8211; vation to depend on faith in a doctrine which no one
                has yet correctly expounded&#44; and which is capable of no rational and
                satisfactory exposition. There may be many persons who can take up such a religion
                and profess to believe in its entire truth and efficacy&#44; who fancy that&#44; in
                this blind yielding to an ill&#8211;defined dog&#8211; ma&#44; they have found peace
                and the assurance of a for&#8211; giveness for all their sins&#44; and a certainty
                that nothing obstructs their onward march to celestial felicity&#44; the moment that
                they have acquired this unnatural belief&#44; and incorporated it with their being.
                But let us not blind ourselves by the appeals which such as these may address to
                us&#44; that we should cast ofi&#34; our own re&#8211; <pb n="221"/> REFLECTIONS ON

                truer&#44; more founded in reason and Scripture a thou&#8211; sand&#8211;fold than
                is anything which they can advance. All religious systems demand an
                acknowledo&#59;ment of a Supreme Power&#44; to whom the creatures are respon&#8211;
                sible for their conduct. Responsibility&#44; however&#44; pre&#8211; supposes
                duty&#59; for without that&#44; we can incur no in&#8211; debtedness. ISTow&#44; if
                we have duties to perform&#44; it means that without accomplishing them we have
                in&#8211; curred guilt&#44; no matter how strong and earnest our faith or belief may
                be in the one who is the author of the system of duties. Nay&#44; the very
                presupposition of justification by faith makea faith itself a duty&#44; para&#8211;
                mount though it be represented to all others &#59; for if it be absolutely necessary
                to salvation that we believe in a certain series of doctrines&#44; the absence of
                this be&#8211; lief will insure our condemnation. If we thus sift the meaning of the
                idea of a justification by other means than a submission to the dictates of active
                religion&#44; we shall discover that the mode of obedience to duty is only
                changed&#44; not&#44; however&#44; that the existence and ne&#8211; cessity thereof
                are removed. Consequently the diflfer&#8211; ences between Judaism and other creeds
                is but a con&#8211; sideration as to the nature and amount of duties to be
                observed&#44; since all are agreed in fact&#44; if not in woi&#39;ds&#44; that they

                &#63; Is it tliat mere faith is demanded &#63; &#8212; or are duties of various
                kinds therein specified&#63; Strange&#44; however&#44; as it may appear to those who
                know not the truth&#44; there is nevertheless not a single expression in all the
                books of Moses which can even be tortured to mean that there exists any method
                whatever to obtain the divine favour&#44; except obedience to the revealed words of
                God before we have yet transgressed them&#44; or a return to obedience with
                repentance&#44; and a thor&#8211; ouijh rcOTct&#44; in case we have neo&#58;lected
                the teachinir of the Lord. To oppose this with any show of argu&#8211; ment&#44; a
                flat assertion is often made that deeds are of no importance&#59; since all men fall
                far short of a full measure of obedience&#44; wherefore all are under con&#8211;
                demnation in not accomplishing all which the law demands&#59; whence they infer
                farther&#44; that there is yet another power capable of assuming our guilt&#44; if
                we place confidence&#44; faith&#44; or trust in liis ability to relieve us from the
                wrath of our heavenly Father. Many loud assertions are made in this connexion&#44;
                that Ju&#8211; daism is a religion of forms&#44; since it cannot assure its votaries
                a full pardon by anything it teaches&#44; and that&#44; on the contrary&#44; the
                faith of our opponents is full of such assurances&#44; and therefore better
                calculated to assuage the spirit in sickness and death. But the whole of this is an
                error. First&#44; deeds ape of impor&#8211; tance&#44; or else God would not have

                honestly observed and done all in the line of his duty that was accessible to
                him&#44; according to his means and opportunities&#59; and that even an occasional

                or even possible that there is a power&#44; other than our God&#44; to assume our
                guilt&#44; or&#44; in other words&#44; to shield us from the debt of accountability
                to the Deity&#44; it follows that this power must have an independent existence&#44;

                the recurrence of the festival&#42; which we now celebrate&#44; it well becomes us
                to look into the institu&#8211; tions of our religion in order to obtain a clear and
                comprehensive understanding of what we are to be&#8211; lieve and what is required
                of us to do as sons of Israel. Let us therefore take for our contemplation this day
                the following verse from the forty&#8211;third of Isaiah&#58; &#34; You are my
                witnessos&#44; saith the Lord&#44; and my servant whom I have chosen &#59; in order
                that you may know&#44; and believe in me&#44; and understand&#44; that I do
                exist&#44; that before me there was no god formed&#44; and after me there will be

                Israel&#39;s testimony. Ill these words&#44; spoken by the imperishable God through
                his messenger&#44; is assigned to us our mission&#44; a mission than which nothing
                more glorious&#44; more hope&#8211; ful can be conferred on man. Glorious I call it
                &#59; be&#8211; cause the Lord of all has selected us from the mass of nations&#44;
                all of whom are his children and his crea&#8211; tures&#44; to testify concerning
                his existence&#44; to proclaim to all his eternity and permanence&#44; to bear aloft
                his standard to which ultimately all mankind are to flock&#44; in order to range
                themselves under its ample folds as children of faith and truth&#44; as followers of
                the only Sovereign of earth and heaven. It is also hopeful &#59; because in all his
                toils man labours in doubt and trembling&#44; lest his exertions be in vain&#44; and
                lest dis&#8211; appointment frustrate the best&#8211;laid plans&#59; but when we
                exert ourselves for the advancement of a divinely appointed task&#44; we are assured
                of ultimate success&#44; though we ourselves fail of beholding the accomplish&#8211;
                ment&#59; for we are to be compared to workmen eu&#58; gaged in rearing a noble and
                magnificent pile&#44; the erection of which will take perchance a century for its
                completion &#59; but the very first stone laid as a foun&#8211; dation&#44; the very
                first trowelful of mortar applied are so much contributed to the accomplishment of
                the great design&#44; which but for this humble commence&#8211; ment could never
                have progressed. &#8212; So then we are like these builders&#44; we have the plan
                before us&#44; the end in view&#44; and wo are cheered on by the hope&#44; the
                certainty I should say&#44; that not a thought will be spent in vain&#44; and not a
                word fall inefficient to the ground by which we stimulate ourselves and others to be
                true to our task&#44; and that every event which transpires&#44; will&#44; united to

                accomplish that which the Lord purposes to effect through our means&#44; and for
                which He has called on us to be his witnesses among the children of man. So let us
                look into the nature of our mission&#44; and let us take due heed that we prepare
                ourselves by all available means to aid in its proper accomplishment. First&#44;
                however&#44; let us ask&#58; &#34;How are we to be dis&#8211; tinguished as
                God&#39;s messengers &#63; is it to be by a pe&#8211; culiarity of dress or
                speech&#44; by seclusion from the world&#63; by misanthropy&#63; or&#44; on the
                other side&#44; by arrogance and contempt of our species &#63; are we to go out into
                the world and exhort other people that they are in error &#63; shall we be active
                missionaries by pub&#8211; licly denouncing the superstitions which we see on all
                sides around us &#63;&#34; To answer these questions&#44; we can look for the only
                solution to the word of the Lord himself&#44; and whatever that teaches is the
                course of conduct which we should adopt. But in reading the Scriptures&#44; we shall
                see that we are not enjoined to wear a peculiar garb&#59; nor are we commanded to
                shut ourselves out from an intercourse with the world&#59; we are not told to hate
                those who differ from us &#58; so on the other side do we not find any authority to
                look with contempt on others and to regard them as inferior to ourselves&#44; nor to
                treat them as though we had received a commission to injure those of God&#39;s
                children who have no correct knowleda&#59;e of their Father in heaven&#59; nor do we
                discover any command to go out among mankind to denounce what we are taught to
                regard as wrong conceptions of important truths&#44; or the actual deeds committed
                against the re&#8211; spect due to the Most High. But what Ave have been <pb n="236"
                /> 236 Israel&#39;s testimony. taught is a system of laws and observances imposed on
                no other people than our own&#44; and we are bidden to fulfil every precept therein
                contained &#59; because the Lord who ordained the same is our God&#44; who has a
                twofold claim to our obdience&#44; the first&#44; because He is the Creator in
                common of our own and all other nations of the earth&#44; and the second&#44;
                because we have peculiar and especial motives of gratitude why we should do what lie
                has required of us&#59; since these very acts are to remind us of those deeds of
                mercy and undeserved benevolence without which the peo&#8211; ple of Israel&#44; of
                which we are the descendants and successors&#44; could not have been in existence
                &#59; inas&#8211; much as they were requisite&#44; first&#44; to deliver them from
                the influence of those who held them in sub&#8211; jection&#44; and secondly&#44; to
                secure their attachment to the law which had been imparted to them as a portion of
                the promised redemption. Now this law does not contain any precept condemning social
                en&#8211; joyments&#59; it does not enjoin hatred of our species&#44; nor does it
                enforce the necessity of a peculiar garb or a particular manner of speaking&#59; but
                on the con&#8211; trary it permits the use&#44; with very few exceptions&#44; of all
                joys and pleasures&#44; and these exceptions are founded upon the injurious tendency
                of the things interdicted&#59; we are told to love our neighbours as ourselves&#44;
                as also the stranger who may be within our gates &#59; to serve even the enemy who
                may require our assistance &#59; and to use as garments any fabric or ma&#8211;
                terial&#44; with the sole limitation of the mixed kinds. In fact tlie Israelite was
                to be so only in his heart and domestic conduct&#44; and not before the world&#44;
                not to be looked upon as an extraordinai&#8211;y and eccentric <pb n="237"/>

                than his neighbour. It is true we have outward acts of reUgion prescribed to us&#44;
                which we are commanded to practise at every occasion when their performance is
                required. But they are not necessarily public ex&#8211; hibitions&#44; only peculiar
                acts of the Israelite&#44; which nevertheless need not be hidden from the eye of
                others differing from him in sentiments&#59; apart how&#8211; ever from these we
                luive no command that we shall show ourselves unlike other persons. If now any one
                fancies that he fulfils a duty by an undue abstinence from enjoyments&#59; if he
                imagines that much fasting&#44; spending many hours in abstract contemplation&#44;
                neg&#8211; lect of business and the requirements of social and political
                relations&#44; are in consonance with Judaism&#44; he certainly misconceives the
                truth &#59; since such a course is nowise commanded or recommended even in
                Scrip&#8211; ture. Moderation in all things&#44; and acts of penance when we are
                self&#8211;convicted of wrong&#44; arc certainly en&#8211; joined&#59; but this is
                something very different from leading a life of monastic seclusion&#44; and looking
                on all worldly pleasures as so many transgressions. All that our religion
                contemplates is to educate men of a superior intellectual power. We shall enter life
                with all the zest and energy of youthful vigour&#44; yet be at all times restrained
                within the limits prescribed by the Bible&#59; we may eat&#44; but the moment we
                discover any discrepancy between our food and what we are taught to abominate as
                unclean&#44; we shall stop and remember that it is by the command of Ilim who gives
                us food that we are now told to restrain our appetite &#59; we may mingle freely in
                society &#59; so soon&#44; however&#44; as we are made conscious that we are in
                danger of beiuii&#59; drawn <pb n="238"/> 238 Israel&#39;s testimony. into the
                commission of deeds which our law con&#8211; demns&#44; we must arrest our will&#44;
                and reflect that our God and Creator&#44; who watches all our acts&#44; commands us
                to make this sacrifice in obedience to his decrees. It is not therefore the outward
                man so much&#44; as the con&#8211; duct&#44; which is to distinguish the
                Israelite&#59; in every thought&#44; in every word&#44; in every act he should
                mani&#8211; fest his consciousness of the superintending watchful&#8211; ness of
                God&#44; which feeling will restrain hini from do&#8211; ing anything which is
                declared to be displeasing to the Lord. But towards God&#39;s creatures&#44; the
                intelli&#8211; gent beings who people the earth&#44; we should be sed&#8211; ulously
                kind and obliging&#44; and omit no opportunity of rendering them any service which
                their situation requires. Still we should take care not to carry com&#8211;
                plaisance so far as to forego our religious obligations&#44; because they may make
                us appear singular or exclu&#8211; sive&#59; since we have a higher obligation than
                mere politeness to guide us in our actions. &#8212; It is now pre&#8211; cisely this
                system of life which is to distinguish us among men &#59; for we should be devoted
                to a venera&#8211; tion of the Supreme and a thorough philanthropy&#34;&#59; but as
                this latter is based upon the respect which we have for all of our species&#44;
                because they are objects of God&#39;s tender care&#44; it follows that duties
                towards the Lord take precedence of all others&#44; and that noth&#8211; ing can of
                right interfere with their execution &#59; be&#8211; cause all men no less than we
                are bound to reiicard the Author of life as the first object whose wishes should be
                consulted and strictly obeyed. &#8212; &#34;Whatever therefore the Bible
                teaches&#44; be it a small or an im&#8211; portant thing&#44; must be the
                characteristic of the Israel&#8211; ite &#59; and it is his province accordingly to

                an entire submission to the will of the Lord. But it may be asked&#44; in the second
                place&#44; &#34; &#34;What do we effect by this quiet&#44; unostentatious exhibition
                of our religion &#63; how can we thereby be witnesses of God&#39;s power&#63; what
                has our ceremonial observances to do in this respect&#63; what does it teach the
                world&#44; what does it declare which otherwise would not be in&#8211; culcated&#44;
                or would not be told &#63; &#34; To these questions we may answer freely&#44; that a
                great deal depends on our being faithful to our religion&#44; and that the world
                receives thereby a testimony of God&#39;s power which otherwise would not be

                practise to this day&#44; and we shall see that they are not the arbitrary resolves
                of men&#44; bent on having a sort of form on which they can unite as on a common
                ground&#44; but that they are specially calculated to com&#8211; memorate great and
                important events in our history&#44; and which will ultimately&#44; as we are
                told&#44; have an important bearing on the affairs of mankind. Just open any part of
                the books of Closes&#44; and you will see observances referred to historical
                events&#44; or con&#8211; nected with and originating in some peculiar feature in
                the origin of our people. So we find circumcision ordained as a sign on the part of
                Abraham and his descendants&#44; that they would be true to the terms of the
                covenant on their part&#44; whereas theLord promised that lEe would be to them a

                the Abrahamic covenant&#44; he says in effect&#44; though no words be spoken&#44;

                time&#44; his people and his kindred&#44; devoted himself&#44; although probed
                through a multitude of trials&#44; to the service and acknowledgment of the One

                evidence of their own adherence to the true faith&#44; they should each and all

                and be perfect.&#34; But one person&#44; to borrow a word applicable only to man and
                not to God&#44; is here speaking. He calls himself &#34; I am&#44; &#34; his

                are a living testimony that Israel&#8211; ites of all aojes and all countries are

                his laws&#44; and that they reject and utterly abhor all thoughts and conceptions
                which are opposed to the belief in the Unity which is theirs&#44; and that they will
                reject and abhor all doctrines which are calculated to brealv ofi&#58;&#39; their
                connexion with the times that are passed&#44; when we went out to follow the
                footsteps of the Lord in the trackless sands of the desert&#44; as the confiding
                bride hastens to her new home&#44; to the house of her newly espoused husband&#44;
                sure of a loving and joyous reception. Yes&#44; they all declare that they know of
                no truth which is not contained in the law&#44; and that they cannot accept any
                doctrine or dispen&#8211; sation which would teach the contrary. They there&#8211;
                fore practise circumcision&#44; they therefore assemble to sanctify the occasion by
                their presence&#44; to assert that they believe in only the One God whom Abraham
                feared and loved&#44; the One who announced himself as the sole Governor of all
                tilings&#44; and whose power is not limited&#44; whose actions are not
                controlled&#44; and whose glory is not shared by any other being&#59; for none can
                exist near Him on earth&#44; there is none be&#8211; side Ilim in heaven. So also
                let us look at the precepts wdiich arc given as memorials of our going out of
                Egypt&#44; and we shall find the same characteristic belonging to them as to our
                first national commandment. We have before <pb n="243"/> Israel&#39;s testimony. 243
                adverted to the fact that the liberation of the Israelites and their wandering
                through the desert&#44; had the efiect of exhibiting nt every step the power and
                greatness of God&#59; thej proved that He who could do all this without let or
                hindrance must be indeed supreme in power and wisdom &#59; consequently that He is
                preemi&#8211; nently the true God&#44; or&#44; as He has taught us to call Him&#44;
                &#34;the Lord the God of Israel.&#34; So whatever we observe of these precepts is in
                fact a declaration that we believe in the supremacy of the God of Israel&#44; and
                that we confide in no other power as having ability to work aught without his
                consent&#44; or to alter the least which He ordains. In saying&#44; therefore&#44;
                that we believe ourselves to be a chosen people&#44; we also at the same time give
                an emphatic testimony against the alleged power of other beings&#44; which have no
                existence except in the distempered imagination of their followers&#44; and can
                therefore not claim our worship or deserve our homage. Were it that there existed
                any other divinity besides the God of Abra&#8211; ham&#44; of Isaac&#44; and of
                Jacob&#44; he could of right contra&#8211; dict what we have been taught to regard
                as sacred&#59; for as a god he must either have coequal power&#44; or at least be
                able to shield us against the wrath of our Father&#44; in case He should be
                ofi&#39;ended at our disre&#8211; gard of his ordinances. Hence do those who believe
                in an association of gods in one confederacy teach that one of the persons abolished
                the law&#44; and nailed it&#44; as they call it&#44; to the cross on which he
                suffered a temporal death in exitiation of the sins of mankind. In contradiction to
                this belief&#44; which is founded upon the assumption that there is a plurality in
                the god&#8211; Lead&#44; we eat the Passover&#8211;bread&#44; we celebrate the Feast

                world specified in the law to thank the Lord for all his goodness&#44; to remind
                our&#8211; selves at each act that it is in obedience to a perpetual divine command
                proceeding from the unalterable and eternal God that we observe to do these
                things&#44; even as He has enjoined on us in his law given through his servant
                Moses. Understand&#44; therefore&#44; that it is not so much the mere ceremonial act
                which we per&#8211; form in the various matters appertaining to the festi&#8211;
                vals&#44; as the deep sense accompanying them which gives them value. And whether
                j&#8211;ou eat the unleav&#8211; ened bread or wave the palm&#8211;branch&#44; it is
                a testimony that you truly believe in the recorded word of God&#44; and that you
                affirm your adherence to the ancient covenant in all its binding force and
                obligation&#44; and that you moan to look for salvation solely through the mercy of
                the Lord &#59; inasmuch as you hope that lie will accept in fiivour your
                service&#44; and purify in his goodness whatever you may deface in the moral
                ex&#8211; cellence of your soul through the liability to sin&#44; to which human
                nature is always prone. And whether you listen devoutly to the sounding of the

                for worship on the day of the Pentecost&#44; or this festival of conclusion&#44;
                distinguished by no pecu&#8211; liar ceremonial&#44; you again declare that you
                utterly reject the assumption that the law has been abolished&#59; because you
                assert that the person&#44; who&#44; it is alleged to have done so&#44; has no
                divine power&#44; is no god&#44; has no existence&#44; consequently that he could

                Israel&#44; from that obligation which your Father imposed on you when lie chose you
                from all nations to be his. It is not then the minuteness of the observances&#44;
                nor the little evident meaning which they at times present to the mere
                rationalist&#44; which should lessen their value in your eyes&#59; for be&#8211;
                hold it is in little things in which you can succeed to a full measure to be
                obedient&#44; and it is these very acts&#44; as was said on a former occasion&#44;
                which more than anything else show that they proceeded from the liigh&#8211; est
                Wisdom&#44; as human invention would have taxed its utmost ingenuity to find some
                act of a magnificent kind for each festival to render it fit for the acceptance of
                the divine JSIajesty. But now it is a scries of small things to outward appearance
                which is demanded&#44; and by observing it&#44; we declare that we confide in the
                Wisdom whence it sprung&#44; and bear witness that we believe in the sole existence
                of the Eternal One from wdiom it emanates&#44; as we are assured in the law. It is
                in this way that our ceremonial acts&#44; in making a bar between us and other
                nations&#44; prove us to be ad&#8211; herents to the God of Abraham&#44; who
                subsequently became the national God of the Israelitish people&#44; not as excluding
                his rule over all other people&#44; but be&#8211; cause&#44; except among us&#44;
                the divine power was sup&#8211; posed to be lodged in a multiplicity of beings&#44;
                whose power nevertheless falls short of our Adored One&#44; even if we allow the
                utmost weight to the supersti&#8211; tious views of antiquity which have come down
                to us. This has also been the mission of Israel&#44; to be always on earth&#44; and
                to declare by our simple presence that we believe that there is a higher Power than
                any whom the nations profess to worship&#44; and that there 21&#42; <pb n="246"/>
                246 Israel&#39;s testimony. is no actual truth in any system except in the law which
                God himself proclaimed. This has heen our appointment&#59; and we have acted up to
                its spirit through many a vicissitude and trihulation &#59; and even when we refused
                to obey&#44; the evils which ever and anon befell us called us back to our
                station&#44; and will&#8211; ing or unwilling we have been compelled to testify to
                the truth of God&#39;s words&#59; inasmuch as obedience proved how happy all are who
                thoroughly confide in his law&#44; and since whenever we disregarded the in&#8211;
                junctions of religion the sad consequences of our de&#8211; reliction soon convinced
                us that it is not an idle threatening which the Bible denounces against back&#8211;
                sliders&#44; and that the Lord has ample means to exe&#8211; cute whatever He has
                announced through his prophets. In this manner&#44; then&#44; have we from the
                beginning of our national origin vindicated the judgments of God&#44; and thereby
                proved at the same time his exist&#8211; ence&#59; whereas these things could not
                have been&#44; were there not a divine Providence acting uniformly&#44; and always
                influencing the affairs of men. And do you believe that this silent teaching has
                been without its effect&#63; do you imagine that our example has been lost on the
                great mass of human beings not belonging to Israel &#63; Then look around you&#44;
                and see what has occurred. Thirty centuries ago our nation sprung up in the desert

                Brethren&#33; The Psalmist says &#58; &#34; The nations shall praise Thee&#44; O God
                I the nations all shall praise Thee. The people shall rejoice&#44; and sing for joy
                &#59; for thou wilt judge the nations righteously&#44; and govern the people of the
                earth.&#34; Ps. Ixvii. 4&#44; 5. It may perhaps strike you as singnhxr that the
                Scriptures represent the world as rejoicing when God executes judgment&#59; and you
                may ask&#44; &#34;Is not pun&#8211; ishment meted out when God sits in judgment on
                sinners&#63; Is not even his righteousness the signal for retribution on
                evildoers&#63; Why then are men bidden to rejoice&#63; to give thanks for such an
                event&#63; stay&#44; how can all be included in the admonition&#63; Are they too to
                utter praise who feel the weight of the visitation&#63;&#34; These questions open
                for us a field of inquiry into the nature of the Divine government&#44; and the
                relative position of the sons of man to Him&#44; their Judge and Ruler. In the first
                place&#44; then&#44; when God sits in judgment&#44; punishment is meted out to those
                deserving it&#59; his very righteousness is condemnation to the transgres&#8211;
                sors. But this is&#44; in the second place&#44; actual cause for rejoicing&#44; even
                to those who are reached by the visi&#8211; tation which their deeds have merited.
                Let us see. Were a man to judge the acts of his fellows&#44; he might enter upon the

                from hearsay and from circumstances&#44; have to combine broken chains of
                evidence&#44; to reconcile con&#8211; tradictions&#44; and to sift the correctness
                of the denial or of the mute refusal of the criminal to plead at all. If&#44; after
                all this&#44; a verdict is rendered&#44; how clear soever the evidence may appear to
                you&#44; there is left room to doubt in the minds of others. Therefore&#44; there is
                no universal rejoicing at the rendition of human judg&#8211; ment&#59; and what one
                party would characterize as jus&#8211; tice&#44; as necessary to the peace of the
                state and the safety of society&#44; is styled by the other unnecessary cruelty and

                independence to discharge his duty despite of the popular clamour&#59; whereas&#44;
                those whose interest is affected by the decision will pour out the full meas&#8211;
                ure of their wrath on the obsequious magistrate&#44; as they call him&#44; for
                perverting justice and condemning the innocent. But when the Lord Almighty sits in
                judgment&#44; there is no room left to accuse llim of prejudice&#44; of
                ignorance&#44; and fallibility&#59; since He has a knowledge of all things as they
                occur constantly before Him. He need not&#44; therefore&#44; ask the accused&#59; He
                need not wait their pleading&#44; their confession&#44; or their denial. Their
                silence does not confound his omniscience &#59; their speech does not wipe away his
                knowledge&#44; nor render uncertain of what their own doings have made Him

                presented to him&#59; his power of judg&#8211; ing is abridged &#59; and hence
                arises his partiality for or against what he is to decide on. But the Lord sees not
                with human eyes&#59; He looks at all deeds divested of every species of favour or
                ill&#8211;will. Hence&#44; he sees everything as it is&#59; the good&#44; in its
                imperfect state&#44; but crime&#44; also&#44; lacking much of the full measure which
                its originators contemplated&#59; and hence He brings to the office of the Universal
                Judge all the requirements necessary to enable Him to render per&#8211; fect
                justice&#44; and to satisfy the claims of universal equity. He therefore condemns
                individuals and na&#8211; tions who have been weighed in the balance and found
                deticient in merits and burdened with iniquity&#59; and tlie punishment follows in

                &#58; but you cannot avert the early and sure doom which awaits him. In the same
                manner may you often trace direct consequences&#44; natural results&#44; as
                springing from any course of conduct&#44; in nations no less than individual members

                to purify the moral atmosphere by the thunder of their eloquence&#44; by the daring
                with which they oppose the waves of popular corruption. But barely are they called

                fathers&#44; and that the same means which they em&#8211; ployed to build up a
                glorious fabric are not necessary to sustain it erect. Hence they rush into

                nothing in the shape of uninterrupted prosperity can arrest the downward course of
                events&#59; and should peace continue for a hundred centuries&#44; you would still
                say that such a state carries within it the seeds of its own dissolution. So sank
                Babylon&#44; so sank Hellas&#44; so sank Rome&#59; it was because corruption had
                usurped the place of virtue&#44; enervating luxury the place of simplicity of
                manners&#59; and it required scarcely a prophet&#39;s eye to foresee the downfall of

                If we now believe&#44; as men wdio trust in Providence&#44; that God watches over
                the deeds of his creatures &#58; what more natural result should we expect than that

                voice of God which speaks in national calamities&#44; &#44; which forewarns before
                the final destruction. It is the cahimity of sickness which precedes the death of
                the individuals&#58; it is the upheaving of the elements which warns in national
                events. Is it war&#63; we may fairly assume that violence and injustice have been at

                ternal discord&#44; misgovernment&#44; pride and arrogance have called on
                Heaven&#39;s tribunal for visitation to re&#8211; mind the inhabitants of the earth
                of their misdeeds. Is it the pestilence which ravages the land &#63; then let us be
                certain that moral corruption has testified against a country&#44; and that the
                destroyer has been sent to admonish men to repent them of their evil deeds. Men may
                say what they please&#44; they may gloss over their faults with ever so much
                ingenuity &#59; but it is all in vain &#58; the Judge of all the earth sees their

                measure as iniquity is found to pre&#8211; vail&#44; so will national calamities be
                seen to follow in their train. But one thing is to be considered here also.
                JSTations must not think that&#44; because they have not suffered nationally&#44;
                they have no collective sins to answer for&#59; because it is with them as it is
                with sinners in general&#44; punishment does not always follow immediately on the
                transgresoioii. We cannot place ourselves in the judgment&#8211;seat of God&#44; and
                condemn or approve in his stead&#44; to pronounce on what de&#8211; serves or does
                not merit retribution&#44; Nor is it cer&#8211; <pb n="256"/> 256 THE DIVINE

                by unheeded&#44; as though they were chance&#8211; blows struck by fortuitous fate.
                There is no such principle as fiite or chance in the world&#39;s government&#59;

                history records&#44; that which has happened&#44; or can by possibil&#8211; ity come
                to pass. To suppose that any power beside God could order any event&#44; would at

                or it is co&#8211;equal or superior to God. The very statement of the question

                mortal in his labour. The Omniscient surveys all things at one moment&#44; and
                exerts his power in every direction at the self&#8211;same time&#58; whereas man
                sees but what is within his horizon&#44; and of this but a small portion distinctly
                &#59; and while he is engaged in one thing&#44; everything else becomes excluded
                from his sphere of action. If&#44; therefore&#44; any object be ever so small&#44;
                it is still within God&#39;s field of vision &#59; it is a part of the entire mass
                of things&#44; consequently open and accessible to Him&#44; without any effort or
                peculiar labour. Hence He can exert his influence&#44; as He ac&#8211; tually
                does&#44; in the most minute events&#44; and regard with paternal care all the
                variety of objects through&#8211; out the whole creation. Impossibility is
                accordingly no word which can be applied to God&#44; as&#44; also&#44; noth&#8211;
                ing is unworthy of his tiotice. If chastisement be now felt on earth&#44; we must
                recognize it as a manifes&#8211; tation of Providence&#44; exerted for the
                improvement of mankind &#59; for&#44; since we cannot assume that the Most Holy
                would act without an object&#44; and as He delights not in the pain of his
                creatures&#44; we must arrive at the 22&#42; <pb n="258"/> 258 THE DIVINE JUDGMENT.
                conclusion that He means thereby to purify&#44; to cor&#8211; rect&#44; to elevate
                those who otherwise might be fatally injured&#44; in case the punishment had not
                been dis&#8211; pensed. We say&#44; therefore&#44; that nations can&#44; nay
                shouhl&#44; thank the Lord though He appear as the Judge&#59; for they may be sure
                that He acts not from caprice or from malevolence&#44; is not impelled by ignorance
                or prejudice to wreak his ill temper upon the resistless mortals that crawl as it
                were in the dust before Him. He knows the national failings&#59; He recognizes the
                transgression of communities&#59; wherefore He bids famine to seize at times on the
                inhabitants of a laud&#44; to destroy for them the harvest in the field&#59; He
                loos&#8211; ens the dogs of war&#44; and havoc is heard in the popu&#8211; lous

                and though to man there may appear no discrimination in the destruction which goes
                forward&#44; we may be assured that not a hair falls to the ground without the
                Judge&#39;s knowl&#8211; edire and assent. And when communities see them&#8211;
                selves thus exposed toithe wrath of the Father&#44; should they not pause in their
                career &#63; Should they not re&#8211; flect and see what there is to amend &#63;

                there are no detailed national stat&#8211; utes obligatory on non&#8211;Israelites
                according to the let&#8211; ter of the Bible. But there is an error in this&#44;
                which arises in confounding the ceremonial duties with the universal principles of
                morality and justice which the Word of God has revealed. It is only true of the law
                which Moses commanded us that it is the inherit&#8211; ance of the congregation of
                Jacob. But all else be&#8211; sides is the universal inheritance of mankind&#59; and

                obligation of obeying its behests as implicitly as we of the house of Israel. Was
                it&#44; you think&#44; unjust for God to send Jonah to preach destruc&#8211; tion

                their national crimes&#44; their sinning against the laws of humanity&#44; their
                treason against the rights of man. Hence&#44; you must come to the conclusion that
                the laws of morality and neighbourly love apply alike to the whole family of
                man&#44; especially those who have received a knowl&#8211; edge of them by having a
                transcript of the Scriptures in their possession. It matters not how this

                prophets descended from Abraham &#58; it is enough that the law is known to
                civilized men&#44; and this is sufficient to make it as binding on them all as it
                was originally on us. We may therefore hold up the Bible to our neigh&#8211;

                prevails&#44; and where security oflife and all pursuits is based upon the firmest
                foundation. That these too often neglect the laws which most benefit them&#44; is a
                thing to be expected from the natural tendency of men to be sin&#8211; ful &#59; and
                we therefore recognize the mercy of God in his judgment&#44; that lie recalls them
                occasionally by his retributive decrees to bethink themselves of their course to
                regain the favour which they are in danger of losing. It will&#44; therefore&#44; be
                happy for them if they amend the evil of their way betimes&#44; and wait not till

                send healing to those already suffering from its at&#8211; tacks. It was the will of
                our Father to listen to the sighs and the prayers of the many who humbled

                oft&#39;er our prayers and thanksgiving at this season of rejoicing&#44; because of

                in the attitude which the world at large occupies to&#8211; wards the Jews. The
                Bible apparently says one thing&#44; and the world another&#59; the Scripture speaks
                of Israel&#44; the world insists that some other persons are meant&#59; and still we
                stand in the same position we always have stood&#44; and it would be curious&#44;
                indeed&#44; if the error should be on our part&#44; and that we must&#44;
                therefore&#44; have been all along groping our way in doubt and darkness. One of two
                things must be admitted&#44; either we are right now&#44; or were always wrong&#59;
                or&#44; it must be exhibited by undoubted proof&#44; that we have at some time&#44;
                since the Bible was delivered into our safe&#8211;keeping&#44; changed our
                position&#44; that is to say&#44; that we commenced a different course of life from
                what we were accustomed to before. The question then re&#8211; solves itself into
                these simple propositions &#58; Of whom does the Bible speak&#44; when using the
                terms Zion&#44; daughter of Zion&#44; Jacob&#44; Israel&#44; and the like&#63; and
                if it be the literal descendants of Jacob&#44; have these then so far changed their
                mode of life as not to be any longer in the same attitude towards God&#44; which
                they occupied in the time of the prophets&#63; Now&#44; as regards the first
                question&#44; it is to be pre&#8211; sumed that the prophets must have had an
                intelligible meaning in the hearing of those to whom they were sent&#44; to as great
                an extent at least&#44; if not greater&#44; than they have to us at the present day.
                Look&#44; therefore&#44; into their works&#44; as we may freely call the writings or
                records of prophecy which have come down to us&#44; and you will see that they are
                uniformly addressed to their own countrymen&#44; when they call them by name&#44; or
                by some metaphorical expression which as clearly <pb n="265"/> INTERPRETATION OF
                PROPHECY. 265 defined them. Whenever they wanted to speak to and of other
                nations&#44; whenever they referred to other countries than Palestine&#44; they did
                not lack words to give a clear expression of their ideas&#44; and we may be assured
                that&#44; if any obscurity does exist in the pro&#8211; phetic writings&#44; it is
                owing to our want of knowledge of the attendant circumstances under which they were
                composed&#44; and not to any defect in information on the part of the sacred writers
                themselves. There is so much sublimity&#44; such force&#44; such elegance&#44; such
                pre&#8211; cision in their denunciations and promises&#44; that no one&#44; with any
                degree of common sense&#44; can for a mo&#8211; ment have any doubt of their general
                tendency&#59; and only the expressions of an unknown signification can at all be
                relied upon as an excuse for an occasional misapprehension. But&#44; to say that
                Israel is not Israel&#44; that Zion means Rome&#44; or Athens&#44; or anything else
                than the veritable city of David&#59; that the daughter of Zion or Jerusalem means
                the church&#44; whatever that may be&#59; that Jerusalem means an association of
                some sort&#44; founded upon another scheme than the upholding of the unity of
                God&#44; is to argue as though words had no definite meaning&#44; and were intended
                to conceal&#44; not to express thoughts. And even granted for a moment that the
                sacred messengers when ad&#8211; dressing Israel meant actually some other
                nation&#44; a question would naturally arise as to the new identity. We will state
                the proposition&#58; Israel is not the natural Israel&#44; Zion is not the city of
                David&#44; the one well known in history&#44; the other in the geography of the
                world. Where are we now to look for them&#63; are we to go to Arabia to hunt for the

                ter&#59; and hence&#44; the Arabs may be the new Israel and their holy city the new
                Jerusalem. But this will not satisfy our ISTazarene neighbours&#59; they claim to be
                an Israel more spiritual than the Jews&#44; more elect than the foUowers of
                Mahomed&#44; and hence&#44; they assert that all the blessings are centred in them
                &#59; that all the good the prophets speak of is&#44; or will be&#44; fulfilled in
                and through them&#59; and though some will not ex&#8211; clude the literal
                descendants of Jacob altogether&#44; they do it with so many qualifications as to
                render any good to be expected for the Jews&#44; as such&#44; totally valueless for
                them in a national point of view. Per&#8211; haps&#44; no Avords have ever been so

                possibly recog&#8211; nize them under their new guise&#44; though he have written
                them himself. What this spiritual rendering may be&#44; depends altogether upon the
                circumstances of the case &#59; it may be one thing&#44; or it may be the other. For

                the house of Israel&#59; so far the spiritualizers will go with us&#59; but how many
                sin&#8211; gular applications have not been made of this vision or actual
                occurrence&#44; in which Ezekiel&#44; by the com&#8211; mand of God&#44; revived so

                you will find glorious promises for the descendants of Jacob&#44; the assurance of a
                resurrection&#44; a restoration to the land of Israel&#44; and the prediction of
                life. But before the spiritualist reaches thus far&#44; he has already exhausted his
                ingenuity on the vision of the dry bones&#59; he fancies&#44; therefore&#44; that he
                has done enough in im&#8211; agining that the fleshless remains of humanity
                pre&#8211; figurate the spiritual wants of our people at the pres&#8211; ent day
                &#59; and the breath which was to return into the bodies of the slain&#44; he
                imagines to be his pretended new revelation which&#44; as was already then
                foreshadowed&#44; should supplant the old system in our possession. But I pray you
                read the first fourteen verses of the thirty&#8211;seventh chapter of Ezekiel&#44;

                Bible con&#8211; vey&#44; and you will not find a word of a new law&#44; a modern

                Israel&#44; and that they shall live&#44; and be brought back to live in peace in
                their own land. Where do you discover liere any allusion to a new law&#63; to a
                revela&#8211; tion not then known&#63; to a spirit which was to be foreign to our
                religion&#63; Or you may say the new law is to be identical with the old&#44; a
                perfection of its original principles&#59; but Ezekiel speaks of no such change or
                addition as impending over the religion which he then professed&#44; and surely no
                one will say that the modern system of the ISTazarenes is identical in any shape
                with the conduct of Israelites under the ancient law. This spiritualizing has not
                even the advantage of the word neiu being introduced into the prophecy&#44; so as to
                read &#34; And I will put my new spirit in you&#44; and you shall live&#44; &#34;

                some in&#8211; struction derived from a source other than the Bible&#44; you cannot
                discover in the whole passage an allusion to the alleged repeal of the Jewish Law.

                and Jerusalem. They&#44; of course&#44; mean the literal city when it is said that

                natural con&#8211; sequence of departing from the Law of God. If the gentiles&#44;
                in forsaking their idols&#44; had candidly said that they adopted those parts of the
                Bible which were obligatory on them&#44; according to the well&#8211;established

                when the power of the Lord would bo made manifest to all creatures&#44; when all men
                would receive an especial direction how to obey the will of God in tlie new state of
                things whicli is then to prevail. But the gentiles&#44; in their new zeal&#44; could
                not be so toler&#8211; ant&#59; they wanted to establish their adherence to God on a
                new basis&#44; on one essentially difl&#39;ering from the standard of Israel &#59;
                and hence&#44; in taking the Scrip&#8211; tures as their guide&#44; they had from
                necessity to abol&#8211; ish the literal sense of the words&#44; because this
                in&#8211; dicted their views and contradicted their opinions at every turn. I could

                manner of conducting tlie argu&#8211; ment in the gentile way&#44; and its entire
                unsoundness. &#34;Whatever fancied reasons the opponents of Judaism may have to
                carry a spiritual&#44; or rather an allegorical sense into the plain views of the
                Bible&#44; it will not be satisfactory to any one who&#44; either for the first time

                osten&#8211; sibly mean&#44; neither more nor less than what common sense would
                understand by them. I know that I may be met by the question as to what becomes then
                of the traditional expositions which we have received &#63; Eut&#44; indeed&#44;
                they are all based upon the words of the Bible as they were understood at the time
                they were written. Reflect well that the original text of Scrip&#8211; ture is not
                any longer the vernacular of any country&#59; ages have passed since it has been
                merely a sacred dialect of our people. Consequently the very meaning of words
                depends upon traditional evidence &#59; where&#8211; fore we must submit to be
                instructed from father to son as to what Israelites always believed they were
                com&#8211; manded to do. I speak not now of the few rabbinical ordinances which are
                not founded on the Bible at all&#44; as they are mere regulations made in the spirit
                of the Scriptures&#44; and are not to be looked for in the words themselves &#59;
                for instance&#44; the ligliting of the Ilanuk&#8211; kah lamps&#44; the reading of

                and&#44; therefore&#44; corrupted by a process so unreasonable. For instance&#44;
                say that Israel is not Israel&#44; and that Zion is not Zion&#44; it will be next to
                impossible to assign them any tangible and satisfac&#8211; tory meaning. I may
                contend&#44; in the potencj&#8211; of my intellect&#44; that Israel is put for
                Russia&#59; another nuiy claim it with equal right to be Japan or the distant isles
                of the sea. I may say Zion meant Rome&#59; an&#8211; other will have the same right
                to find in Stamboul or London the mystical prototype of the ancient city of David.
                One may transform Jerusalem into the church&#44; that is&#44; his own peculiar form
                or mode of worship and belief&#59; but&#44; another may&#44; with equal right&#44;

                sole heirs of all the good that it is predicted for restored Jerusalem. It would be

                the terms which were adduced signify literal Israel&#44; and the literal habitations

                It is this Sabbath just a quarter of a century since this building was opened anew
                for the worship of the Most High&#44; the God and Father of Israel. Many of those
                who then rejoiced that the goodJy work had been accomplished have gone to their
                reward&#44; and the cold grave now embraces many whose heart then beat with bright
                anticipations of a happy future&#44; who stood there in the vigour of manhood and
                the pride of beauty &#59; and others who were then young have ad&#8211; vanced to
                old age&#44; and their firm step is now changed to a trembling walk&#44; and the
                light of their eye is dimmed&#44; and daily they feel more and more that they have
                approached that period of their days in which they cannot enjoy the pleasures of
                social intercourse and the gayeties and frivolities of earlier years. The worldly
                fortunes&#44; too&#44; of many have since that day greatly changed &#59; some have
                sunk into poverty and distress&#44; or have by misconduct lost the high position
                they held in society&#59; others&#44; however&#44; have acquired wealth and

                is seen in their dwellings. But&#44; iiore still&#44; a new generation has since
                then come into heing&#44; and a new race of believers has sprung from the loins of
                the faithful&#44; and there are here many on that day unborn who glory in the name
                of Israel&#44; and who are ready to carry yet farther the joyful message which our
                fathers heard at the foot of Mount Sinai&#44; and they are willing to endure sorrows
                and hardship in the defence of the hope and faith of their ancestors. Tell me not
                that the age of enthusiasm is altogether past&#44; and that the men of the present
                day are not ca&#8211; pable to follow their God on the path of affiiction which our
                fathers have trod &#59; tell me not that the sin&#8211; cerity of Israel has
                departed forever&#44; that nothing but interest and love of gain sway the mind of
                the people. Tliere are evils&#44; sore evils&#44; besetting our onward march to
                improvement&#59; we have fallen on evil times&#44; when wealth is so highly
                valued&#44; when interest so greatly sways the multitude. All this is true. Still
                there is life in Israel&#44; there is a spirit in the sons of Jacob &#59; the one
                may seem extinct&#44; the other may ap&#8211; pear dormant&#59; but let danger once

                suiter&#44; millions ready to sacrifice all&#44; to sustain their faith in their

                tide of desolation by the poor of the spirit&#44; by an endurance which nothing can
                overcome&#44; which nothing can conquer&#59; and it is this life and this spirit

                for what purpose do we raise synagogues&#44; as houses of assembly lor the sons of
                Israel &#63; Is it to add to the architectural beauty of the cities in which we
                live&#63; is it to gratify our eyes by the elegance of the structures which we have
                aided in erecting&#63; As&#8211; suredly not&#59; it is to dignify the worship of
                God&#44; to establish unto his holy ISTanie houses where we can meCL to strengthen
                each other in the fear of the Lord and the observance of his commandments. Silently
                the servants of the Most High pray in solitude in the shadow of their own
                chambers&#44; when first they enter a city or country. They are surrounded by those
                who honour not the Holy One of Israel&#59; they bear within themselves in their
                residence the sole witnesses of the blessed Unity&#44; whose praise will at one time
                fill the world. Anon others join the insignificant brother&#8211; hood &#59; and
                those&#44; who once perhaps denied their God from dread of being known as Jews&#44;
                now come for&#8211; ward and claim affinity with their brothers&#59; and speedily is
                heard the sound of the hammer&#44; and the trowel is plied to put cement between the
                stones&#59; and the roof is raised&#59; the walls are plastered within&#44; and
                there is a place provided for the law&#44; the testimony descended to us

                of his kingdom forever and ever.&#34; And&#44; behold&#44; the work is thus

                courage and exalted hope&#44; and there is established a home for the law of

                and to convince the doubters of the truth and mercy of God. It matters not&#44;
                then&#44; so far as the truth is concerned&#44; whether our places of meeting be
                large or small&#44; ornamental or simple&#44; pro&#8211; vided only the proper
                spirit animates the founders&#44; and whether after they have been opened&#44; they
                are filled according to the number of the community with devout worshippers&#44;
                with those who feel it a serious thing to be Israelites&#44; who shrink not from the
                sacri&#8211; fices which the observance of religion demands at their hands. With
                true devotion&#44; in a full attendance of worshippers&#44; is a small&#44; plain
                building a proper place of residence for the Most Holy One&#59; but if the
                worshippers be absent&#44; or if they have no regard for the interests of their
                faith&#44; if they merely come to show themselves on particular occasions&#44; on
                some great festivity&#44; or Avhen something especial draws them thither &#8212; if
                such be the character of the people&#58; the beauty&#44; the spaciousness&#44; and
                the elegance of the building are as nothing&#44; but are a mockery rather of the
                Holy Spirit who alone can sanctify the work of our hands&#44; whose acceptance
                solely can add any value to our worship&#44; whose grace and mercy only can
                ac&#8211; complish what we humbly commence. Truth and sincerity&#44; humility and
                love&#44; are the elements of con&#8211; secration &#58; let these be absent&#44;
                and all the ceremonies&#44; all the anthems&#44; all the appeals of the endowed poet

                offered up with so much of worldly deceit. If thus it is the spirit of devotion
                which makes the synagogue a place of proper divine worship&#44; it is necessary for
                us to seek how it may be obtained by us. The answer as usual can only be found in
                the Scriptures&#44; and not in the philosophy and experience of the most learned. In
                the section of the law read to&#8211;day we find the following &#58; &#34; And the
                Lord said to Moses and Aaron&#44; This is the ordinance of the
                Passover&#8211;sacrifice&#44; no son of the stranger shall eat of it.&#34; Exod.
                xii. 43. To this verse say our commentators &#34;Any one whose deeds have become
                alien to his Father in heaven &#59; and this therefore does not merely exclude the
                gentile from participating in the Passover&#8211;sacrifice but the apostate
                Israelite also.&#34; Wc here see wdiat sort of a man it is who is admitted to eat of

                with his Father in heaven&#44; whose conduct has rendered him a proper inmate in the
                mansion of his God&#44; and who feels not as a stranger when he enters his
                Master&#39;s house&#44; nor is ashamed when mingling in acts of re&#8211; ligion
                with his fellows in faith. The Passover&#8211;lamb&#44; <pb n="283"/> ISRAEL&#39;S
                TRUE ALLEGIANCE. 283 as you well know&#44; was first prepared by the Israelites in
                Egypt in the afternoon preceding the night of the slaughter of the first&#8211;born
                of their oppressors &#59; the blood of the victim was sprinkled on the upper sill
                and the two door&#8211;posts of the houses of the Hebrews as a sign&#44; so the
                Bible expresses it&#44; that the destroyer should not be permitted to enter the
                dwellings of the Israelites&#44; when he went forth to smite among the Egyptians. It
                may strike you here as curious&#44; that such a sign was demanded&#59; for you will
                ask&#58; &#34;Did not the messenger of the Lord know which was the house of the
                Israelite&#44; without the few drops of blood of a slaughtered sacrifice which
                stained the door&#8211; posts &#63; &#34; Assuredly &#59; there was no need for God
                to know by a sign the domicil of his people &#59; nor did his messenger require this
                token to distinguish those whom he was to spare. For&#44; though death was
                fear&#8211; fully busy in that night&#44; though thousands fell in a moment of tipie
                beneath the stroke of the unseen sword which was unsheathed in every house&#44; in
                every prison where the oppressors dwelt&#44; no harm befell those whom God
                protected&#59; because He had promised to distinguish them in the hour of peril&#44;
                because of the word announced to their fathers&#44; that at the ap&#8211; pointed
                time He would release them from thraldom&#44; and humble those who had made them
                labour. It was therefore at present the business of Providence&#44; so to say&#44;
                to mark the true children of the covenant&#44; to call their own attention to their
                descent and to the blissful promises for the future which awaited them&#58; and
                accordingly we read&#44; nx&#94; D3b mn n&#94;m &#34;And the blood shall be unto
                yourselves for a sign &#59;&#39;&#34;&#39; the Israel&#8211; ites should&#44; on

                &#34;And I will see the blood&#44; and pass over you&#44; and there shall not be
                among you a plague as a destroyer&#44; when I smite in the land of Egypt.&#34; The
                protection is oflered conditionally&#59; only if they obeyed&#44; should there be an

                obedience&#44; he would have forfeited Ins rights&#44; and suffered with others not
                numbered among Israel. The exemption thus was&#44; like other rewards&#44; made to
                depend on a measure of obedience&#44; and this removed at the same time all charge
                of partiality which the idolaters might have urged against the Holy One&#44; by
                alleging that the Is&#8211; raelites too had worshipped the vanities of Egypt. But
                so soon as they stepped out from the trammels of the pollution into which they had
                been sunk&#59; so soon as they adopted the Lord as their Master&#44; and obeyed&#44;
                without flinching from the danger they en&#8211; countered by slaughtering the
                cherished objects of Egyptian superstition&#44; they became worthy of the
                discriminating Providence which passed over their houses&#44; whilst the cry of
                terror issued from palace and hovel&#44; IVom temple and prison. The Egyptians had

                him&#44; if persuasion had been needed&#44; to persevere in his contest against the
                power of the Omnipotent. Consequently&#44; if such persistence in wrong&#8211;doing
                demanded punishment&#44; they were justly dealt with&#59; and if their victims&#44;
                they who had so long groaned under their resistless cruelty&#44; had en&#8211; tered
                upon a more religious life in the full sense of the words &#59; if they had become
                willing to forsake the fertile homes of the Nile&#44; which had become endeared to
                them through long residence and association&#44; to travel away into the dreary
                wilderness without a store of provisions and water&#44; burdened with numerous herds
                and flocks&#59; laden with all their household goods&#44; bound to look after the
                Avcll&#8211;being of their wives and little ones&#59; exposed also as they were to
                the attacks of the valiant and dreaded children of the desert&#44; whose fiery
                war&#8211;horses rush quick as the lightnins&#58; over the unsteady surface of the
                sandy plains&#44; who are inured to rapine and plunder from their infancy&#44; who
                spare neither the suckling&#44; nor have mercy on the aged&#44; &#8212; all this
                proved that they deserved not to be doomed indiscriminately with their masters&#59;
                since they had acquired already a deep faith in the Judge of all the earth. And if
                we add now that the very ceremony they practised in the offering of their first
                national sacrifice must have been odious to their mas&#8211; ters&#44; as even
                Moses&#44; the man without fear&#44; had ex&#8211; pressed but a little while before
                that such a deed would expose them to be stoned by the Egyptians &#58; <pb n="286"/>
                286 ISRAEL&#39;S TllUE ALLEGIANCE. the justice of the Lord is perfectly
                vindicated&#44; since both nations had been invited to acknowledge and to obey tbo
                Almighty&#44; and the one people resisted to the last&#44; whilst the other yielded
                their assent to the reve&#8211; laticfos from Heaven. It was therefore that the
                blood became a token of merit&#44; and obtained for those who had sprinkled it a
                release from the plague&#44; the last and most terrible one of Egypt&#44; and the
                destroyer entered not their houses to smite the first&#8211;born of Israel. Let us
                now see what it was that accompanied the first Passover&#8211;sacrifice &#58; it was
                obedience&#44; faith&#44; and a perfect reliance on the power and mercy of God.
                These qualities therefore procured for our fathers an exemption from slaughter&#59;
                consequently we may infer that their absence would have exposed them at least to
                some punishment&#44; if even the identical visita&#8211; tion which befell Egypt had
                not overtaken them. And as the thoughts of God are from their nature immu&#8211;
                table&#44; the same requisites as were demanded then must be required in all ages
                and times to constitute the character of a faithful Israelite. Whoever there&#8211;
                fore is deficient in obedience to God&#39;s command&#8211; ments&#44; wanting in a
                full faith in the existence of the Unity whom we adore&#44; and imperfect in a
                childlike trust in his mercy&#44; cannot be a perfect child of God&#44; and is not
                to the full extent a son of Israel as were the holy ones from whom we are descended
                &#59; he may be one indeed in the flesh&#44; a son of Abraham by de&#8211;
                scent&#59; but he is an alien to our house in spirit&#44; a changeling whom the
                fathers of our race will not recognize as their own. You will therefore easily
                understand the application of our text and the com&#8211; <pb n="287"/> Israel&#39;s

                afterwards to commemorate the going out of Egypt&#44; was a constant remembrancer of
                the great mercy wrought in our behalf at that eventful time&#59; for &#34; if our
                fathers had not been redeemed&#44; &#34; so teach our sages&#44; &#34; then we and
                our latest descendants would have been servants to Pharaoh in Egypt&#44; &#34; the
                truth of which proposition in its main features is exhibited at this day in the
                wretched state of the Pariah&#8211;caste among the Hindoos&#44; to whose
                organization that of the Egyptian bore a close analogy. Whoever therefore was of
                Israel in the faith&#44; whether native&#8211;born or adopted into the
                congregation&#44; was permitted&#44; nay&#44; commanded&#44; under the most fearful
                threats of divine vengeance&#44; to eat of the sacrifice&#59; still every i&#94;J p
                son of the stran&#8211; ger was excluded. It would almost betoken a con&#8211;
                tradiction in terms to forbid in one verse a descendant of the gentiles to join in
                our festivity&#44; and to admit him in the next one almost. Wherefore our wise men
                have correctly understood the text&#59; it does not in truth speak of a descent from
                Israel or others&#44; but merely of the conduct&#44; of the faith&#44; the trust
                which the individual feels. If he is perfect in all&#44; then let liim come forward

                would be unaccountable were it to stand alone in a position by itself&#44;
                unconnected with the other precepts and duties of religion. There is&#44;
                moreover&#44; no such isolation in our laws &#59; for the whole is inseparably
                interlinked&#44; and one idea sup&#8211; ports the other. The same sanctitication
                which the Passover demands&#44; must be carried into the other parts of our

                willingness to obey&#44; no act of religion can be of any value. Outward obedience
                has indeed its im&#8211; portance&#44; it is the ostensible token of the inward

                practically every day before our eyes&#44; and men&#44; and these Israelites&#44;

                tors instead of the father of the prophets. And still those who thus show themselves
                unworthy of their descent&#44; have perhaps never understood what Moses was&#44; and
                what he taught&#59; they only look upon them&#8211; selves as restricted by his
                dicta&#44; and unjustly circum&#8211; scribed in their pleasures and pursuits by his
                unwel&#8211; come and inopportune injunctions&#44; without at all re&#8211; flecting
                on what they themselves have obtained&#44; and what the world has acquired through
                his instrumen&#8211; tality. I will not dwell upon the miracles which at&#8211;

                object is to benefit mankind&#59; and we are yet to learn that the great leader of
                Israel ever wished to make the sword the arbiter between na&#8211; tions&#44; or
                that he desired to gain the smallest advan&#8211; tao&#8211;e for himself and his
                own household&#44; Moses was designing if you will&#59; but his design was not to
                fasten chains on the limbs of his species&#44; and to make them willing tools of his
                pleasures&#44; or obsequious servanta to his will. Moses established a
                priesthood&#44; a priest&#8211; power&#44; if you will insist on the term&#59; but

                who had the sacred gifts to bestow&#44; and no single priest could claim from any
                individual Israelite&#44; as his just perquisite&#44; the very portions of the holy
                things which he was himself not allowed to consume for his own use. Moses invoked
                the vengeance of God on those who neglected or countervened his doctrines&#59; it is
                true&#44; he wished to impose mental terrors in addition to the arm of political
                power&#44; which he established to restrain evildoers&#59; but it was for a higher
                aim than merely&#34; to engender superstitious fears of unseen harmless things&#44;
                invented to fetter the intellect&#44; and to enslave the understanding&#59; and he
                sought to place virtue&#44; integrity and truth on a more elevated position than a
                mere submission to civil power&#44; where all is resolved into the simple fear of
                punishment&#44; which society must inflict if our makes himself amenable to its
                ven&#8211; geance by committing an injury on others&#44; and be&#8211; coming
                hurtful to his neighbours&#44; or prevents the accomplishment of some public&#8211;
                good by a refusal to assist according to his means&#59; when those whom he injures
                are either bound to restrain his wrongdoing&#44; or to coerce him into compliance.
                Moses&#44; I say&#44; wished to place his followers on a higher platform than such
                motives of action &#59; he laid before them thoughts which they should make their
                own&#59; feelings which they should incorporate with their very being&#59; ideas not
                derived from fear and interest &#59; for he held up to them that&#44; if even the
                civil rulers be satisfied. <pb n="297"/> THE MOSAIC LEGISLATION. 297 there was a
                higher&#44; a holier&#44; a more watchful Head of the state whose demands must be
                heeded&#59; and that every act should be performed&#44; because this Supreme Ruler
                in his commonwealth asks of all his subjects that they should exercise justice&#44;
                mercy&#44; and truth toward one another&#44; because He himself is distin&#8211;
                guished by these attributes&#44; inasmuch as He decides everything according to the
                strictest rule of universal equity&#59; He pardons the repentant&#44; because He
                wills to forgive and not to destroy the offending child &#59; and He is the very
                essence of undefiled truth&#44; as no deceit&#44; no error&#44; no uncertainty can
                by any possibility be con&#8211; ceived as combinable with the idea of his
                perfection. Let us now see what was the state of the civilized world before the time
                of Moses. We have here to deal for the most part with conjectures&#44; as written
                records are wanting&#44; because we know of none which claims a priority to the
                Pentateuch. We may assume&#44; there&#8211; fore&#44; that before it no written code
                of laws was known to man&#59; and that hence all justice was left to the ar&#8211;
                bitrary decision of those in power&#44; Avherefore the weak and helpless had no
                means of redress and no resource but submission to their hard fate. As we find it in
                Egypt and India&#44; it was probably in other countries &#59; indeed&#44; traces of
                the fact are evident in Roman and Grecian history&#44; that the people were divided
                into classes or castes&#44; and that those who belonged to the lowest or labouring
                classes could not attain to the po&#8211; sitions of honour&#44; dignity&#44; and
                othces&#44; which were the heritage of the priestly and military ranks. Nay&#44;
                more&#59; we need not go so far down into antiquity and among the heatlien to search
                for analogies to support the position I have assumed&#59; for even now&#44; in

                of the present gener&#8211; ation in other parts of Europe&#44; there is or was a
                class of nobles&#44; who by a prescriptive right had a large por&#8211; tiou of all
                the territory of the state&#44; and an immense majority of the people as absolute
                and abject slaves&#44; amenable to their will and pleasure. If all this has been and
                is existing still&#44; after so many struggles have been witnessed to recover the
                rights of man from the unjust possessors of power&#59; if all the revolutions which
                the world has seen have left so much to be done &#58; how dreadfully abased must
                have been the condition of the masses in the day of our legislator&#44; when
                king&#8211; craft and priestcraft were able to forge such chains&#44; such galling
                bonds as bound&#44; body and mind&#44; our fathers in Egypt. Recollect&#44; brothers
                &#33; that Jacob and his sons and their children went down into that country as the
                welcome and invited guests of the kins&#58; who then ruled in the land of the
                Nile&#59; that it was he who had assigned to them possessions in the district of
                Goshen&#44; who had promised that they should eat the fat of the land&#44; wherefore
                he had bidden them to leave&#44; without thought or care&#44; their goods and
                chatties in Canaan. Jacob and his sons were free&#8211; men &#59; heroes on whose
                limbs no chains were fastened&#44; whose arms were not entwined by the bonds of the
                tyrant&#44; whose arm wielded the sword and the bow in the defence of their just
                rights&#59; recollect&#44; too&#44; that one of them&#44; the wise Joseph&#44; &#44;
                had by his inspired knowledge saved the country from the atiiiction of a
                seven&#8211;years&#39; famine&#44; which otherwise might have de&#8211; stroyed
                millions of human beings&#44; and rendered the land a howling waste. And yet barely

                immigrants&#44; by reducing them to a state of absolute bondage and involuntary
                labour. How great must have been the power of the sovereign when such an act of
                injustice could be consummated&#44; when such cruelty could be carried into
                effect&#44; without a rebellion of the very in&#8211; struments relied on for

                if the wisest nation of antiquity had either no written laws or such as concentrated
                all power into the hands of one man&#44; who was the head of the priesthood no less

                been the condition of those people who stood upon a point of civilization very far
                beneath the Egyptians. What now was the procedure of Moses &#63; did he invent a new
                system of philosophy to enlighten his people &#63; did he contrive a new chain of
                mysteries in which his followers should be initiated in order to belong to the

                understanding what must ever remain incom&#8211; prehensible to a finite being&#59;
                nor did he surrender to a chosen few especial mysteries and peculiar signs and

                associates. But&#44; on the contrary&#44; he came out boldly with the declaration
                that the God whom he adored was an everlasting Being&#44; too high&#44; too
                powerful&#44; too wise&#44; too holy&#44; too far removed from aught that is
                corporeal&#44; to be comprehended by the finite cfeatures who are mere sojourners in
                this God&#39;s world &#59; that accordingly there was no mystery which one man could
                solve&#44; and which remained concealed from the other&#59; and that all&#44; since

                in life on the earth&#44; one and the same line of conduct to pursue &#59; and hence
                resulted&#44; as a matter of necessity&#44; a uniformity of laws for all&#44; based
                upon their relation to the God who had created them alike&#44; although each human
                being might have different capacities&#44; mental powers&#44; or worldly
                possessions. An absolute physical and mental equality was not predicated as the
                basis of Moses&#39;s teaching&#44; because this equality does not and never did
                exist. But for all this all men are alike in this&#44; that they all derive their
                origin from the will of the same God&#44; are alike objects of his care&#44; are
                alike within his cognizance&#44; and alike responsible to Him&#44; if any

                blood as has been shed in making the experiments in the art of governing and

                tional&#44; &#8212; no greater discovery has been made in the art of government than
                Moses has left us in his code which has been in our possession more than thirty
                centuries&#44; which was obtained without bloodshed&#44; without violent
                debates&#44; without overturning ancient vested rights&#44; and which has stood the
                test of ages without change or amendment. If you will read in connexion the
                promulgation of the Ten Commandments with the subsequent revela&#8211; tion of the
                Most High as described by Moses&#44; you will find that the first object of the
                legislation was the establishment of a civil government composed of men all equal
                under the law&#59; and hence&#44; barely was the basis of our law placed within our
                reach&#44; than we meet with the following injunction &#58; &#34;And these are the
                laws of justice which thou shalt hxy before them.&#34; Exod. xxi. 1. In the simple
                commandments of the Decalogue the Lord had purposed to point out to the people their
                relation to Ilini&#44; and to teach that all the ideas of divine things&#44; as
                acquired by them in their former <pb n="303"/> THE MOSAIC LEGISLATION. 303
                country&#44; were all erroneous and injurious to them if carried out into practice.
                A few general principles as to individual rights had also been imparted&#59; but
                they were not yet in possession of a system of govern&#8211; ment&#44; in which
                these general rules could be success&#8211; fully applied. Hence the first idea to
                be accomplished was to adapt the Decalogue to practical life. And now see&#44;
                instead of organizing as the first object of the Lord his system of worship&#44; the
                manner in which He desired to be adored&#44; He merely proposed laws for the
                establishment of equity and order among his re&#8211; deemed people&#44; aud to
                enable them to know their respective positions in the commonwealth&#44; under every
                possible circumstance. It would detain us too long to examine into the nature of
                every special enact&#8211; ment&#44; and to point out its relative superiority over
                the arbitrary laws&#44; the invention of individual men&#44; or the resolves of
                deliberative assemblies&#44; where com&#8211; promise and mutual concession not
                rarely rule the mind&#44; not absolute notions of right and wrong. But take
                yourselves the trouble to institute a comparison between them and those laws with
                which you happen to be acquainted&#44; and I am sure you will acknowledge that the
                Code of Israel&#44; or if you will prefer&#44; the Code of Moses&#44; contains more
                provisions to secure one man against the violence and malevolence of the other&#44;
                than the constitution of the freest government ever devised by mortals. And thus it
                happened as much by a ra&#8211; tional result from physical causes as by divine
                interpo&#8211; sition&#44; that the Israelitish state flourished as such when&#8211;
                ever the people strictly obeyed the law given through Moses. Their land was
                fertile&#44; because the tillage was carried on on rational grounds&#59; the
                soil&#44; resting every <pb n="304"/> 304 THE MOSAIC LEGISLATION. seventh year&#44;
                had an opportunity to recover from the loss of its vigour&#44; which a continuous
                tillage naturally produces. The remission of debts enabled the poor man to regain
                his independence&#44; which a condition of constant sulyection to a heartless
                creditor is but too apt to undermine&#44; and thus divide the population into nobles
                and plebeians&#44; into the higher classes and the vulgar&#44; into lords and serfs.
                This equalizing prin&#8211; ciple was farther aided by the absolute injunction
                against perpetual servitude of the members of the commonwealth&#44; especially that
                of the Hebrew woman&#44; who could claim her freedom if not espoused by the man who
                had purchased her labour for a time&#44; or if he betrothed her not to his son&#44;
                in which case of mar&#8211; riage she became fully and to all practical purposes his
                wife&#44; with all the rights and privileges belonging to that state among the
                Israelites &#58; whilst at the same time the Hebrew man was free at the end of six
                years&#44; and if he preferred the easy service to his master to a home of his
                own&#44; he was compelled to go at large in the yearof the jubilee&#44; and rejoin
                his family&#8211;circle&#44; restored as he then was to the patrimony which cither
                his faults or misfortune had compelled him to alieiuite. Whilst&#44; then&#44; the
                people obeyed faithfully the law&#44; their land was fertile&#44; their sons were
                free&#44; their daughters were virtuous&#59; there was union in council&#44; and
                vigour in the field&#59; each man had his home&#44; for which he was to strike in
                the hour of danger&#59; his wife&#44; his little ones&#44; were in his mind&#39;s
                eye&#44; whilst the tents of the enemy whitened the plain before him&#59; and he
                thonght of the house of his God&#44; where sat assembled the venerable sages in

                MOSAIC LEGISLATION. 305 the guardianship of the rights and interests of all &#59;
                and he felt himself invincible&#44; he forgot all dangrer&#44; and even if he
                fell&#44; he knew that those dear to him were left as a sacred legacy to his
                countrymen&#44; and that moreover the God of the widow&#44; the Guardian of the
                fatherless&#44; would not forsake those who were cast on his mercy. &#8212; But when
                Israel rebelled&#44; when they tilled the land to exhaustion&#44; when they would
                not lend except on usury&#44; when they forced their brothers and sis.ters into
                slavery&#44; into hopeless servitude&#44; &#8212; our glory departed from us&#59;
                the land became barren&#59; the spirit of independence departed&#44; and past was
                the virtue of their daughters&#44; fled the bravery of their sons&#59; and
                corruption sat in high places&#44; and injustice presided in the courts assembled in
                the precincts of tlie defiled house of God. It was then that the enemy came and
                prevailed&#44; wherever he showed his hated presence&#59; and when the prophet
                Jeremiah&#44; in his thirty&#8211;fourth chapter&#44; had once more begged of his
                brothers to return to the simplicity of the law with an assurance that national
                prosperity should return&#44; and when he was not heeded&#44; when the rebellion
                con&#8211; tinued to augment&#58; the Chaldeans were left at liberty to overthrow
                finally our state&#44; and then was the law of Moses vindicated&#44; and it was

                whose are the knowledge and understanding. Let us lay the result of our sad history
                before the unbeliever&#44; let us show him the analogy between our sinning and our

                fathers &#33; we thank Thee for the many favours which we have received from
                Thee&#44; both as a nation and as individuals. In times long gone by&#44; when we
                groaned under the iron yoke of a Pharaoh&#44; thy ears were open to our cries&#44;
                and Thou didst send thy messenger to break our chains and to let us go free&#44;
                redeemed from slavery&#44; called to thy service. And when nation after nation rises
                against us to blot out our name from the memory of men&#44; Thou dost interpose thy
                holy arm&#44; and snatch us away from the midst of the destruction&#44; like a
                firebrand from the midst of the burning. And daily do we receive thy bounty&#59;
                hourly do we taste thy goodness&#44; inasmuch as Thou art good to all&#44; opening
                thy hand and satis&#8211; fying the desire of every living thing. Bless us&#44;

                thy goodness&#59; do this <pb n="307"/> THE PASSOVER CEREMONIES. 307 for the sake of
                thy holy Name&#44; which rests upon us. Amen. Brethren &#33; On the subject of the
                festival which we now cele&#8211; brate&#44; we read the following &#58; &#34; And
                it shall come to pass&#44; when your children say unto you&#44; What mean ye by this
                service &#63; that you shall say&#44; It is a sacrifice of the Lord&#39;s
                Passover&#44; who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt&#44;
                when He smote the Egyptians and delivered our houses.&#34; Exodus xii. 26&#44; 27.
                In these few words we have the key to the Avhole ceremonial law of Israel&#44; which
                embraces all the ob&#8211; servances commanded by God to Moses&#44; many of which
                were written down in the book of the law which he handed to the priests and Levites
                before his death &#58; while others again&#44; that is&#44; the manner of the
                observ&#8211; ances&#44; were given as oral explanations of the written text&#44;
                and were&#44; for a long time&#44; preserved by tradi&#8211; tion from father to
                son&#44; and thus formed a constant theme for instruction from parent to child&#44;
                from the teacher to his scholar. From our text&#44; we can readily see what the Lord
                intended by the institution of the ceremonies&#44; namely the perpetuation of the
                lesson taught at the time of the Exodus. We have had several times&#44; in the
                course of our lectures&#44; occasion <pb n="308"/> 308 THE PASSOVER CEREiMONIES. to
                state that&#44; by the triumph which the Divine Power obtained over the obstinacy
                .of men who recognized not its existence as residing with the Most High&#44; it
                established&#44; at the time mentioned&#44; the fact which had been acknowledged by
                some rigliteous few from the very beginning of the creation&#44; that the Being who
                announced himself as the God of the ancestors of the Israelitish people was indeed
                the Lord of all existing things&#44; the Creator and Author of the uni&#8211; verse.
                It must be evident to you&#44; that to have merely redeemed our fathers from
                Egypt&#44; and to have given them some abstract doctrinal rules&#44; would have
                re&#8211; sulted precisely as the earlier revelations and miracles had done &#8212;
                a momentary effect would doubtless have been produced&#44; but the result would have
                been what it had been before&#44; that mere doctrines could not have survived the
                changes which time brings about in everything. We do not say that the Lord could not
                have prevented this evil if He had purposed to do so &#59; that by his omnipotent
                power He could not have re&#8211; moved the inclination for sin from every heart at
                one and the same moment&#44; and have made his power acknowledged by every son of
                man. But this pro&#8211; cedure would&#44; as one can easily see&#44; have destroyed
                every species of freedom of will&#44; have abolished&#44; in fact&#44; a principal
                ingredient in the constitution of man&#44; the liberty of choosing between good and
                evil&#44; seeing that he was constrained by a force from above to em&#8211; brace
                opinions&#44; which otherwise he might have re&#8211; jected as unsuited to his
                views. That such a state of mankind might be a happier one than as we now find
                it&#44; may or may not be&#59; it is not for us to decide upon the measures of
                government which proceed from the <pb n="309"/> THE PASSOVEK CEREMONIES. 309 highest
                Wisdom. Enough for our purpose that this change of the human heart did not take
                place at the Exodus&#44; and it has not to this day been witnessed in the world&#44;
                though we cannot determine whether it will not occur at 8ome future day&#59; at
                least the words of prophecy seem to indicate that at the time of our second
                redemption a more ready obedience to the law will .characterize the people of
                Israel&#44; and that the covenant of the Lord will be inscribed in their heart&#44;
                so that it may never again be broken. But still these promises&#44; for which you
                can see many passages in the Prophets&#44; especially Jeremiah and Ezekiel&#44; do
                not so much indicate a determination on the part of the Deity to remove the freedom
                of the human will&#44; as an annunciation that the Divine Spirit will aid those&#44;
                who have remained faithful during the ages of trial in captivity&#44; to fulfil the
                desire of their heart&#44; that is&#44; to obey the law which they had believed in
                before the pouring out of the Spirit&#44; with a more exact com&#8211; pliance than
                when they had to struggle&#44; so to say unaided from above&#44; against the power
                of sin. Be this&#44; however&#44; as it mux&#44; at the time of the Exodus&#44; as
                we have said&#44; a change of the human heart was neither contemplated nor did it
                take place. The Lord meant only to teach man just as he was&#44; sinful&#44;
                igno&#8211; rant&#44; prone to evil&#59; and whatever change was requi&#8211;
                site&#44; should be the slow effect of time&#44; proceeding&#44; as everything else
                in nature&#44; from a certain beginning to an equally fixed termination. How then
                should the doctrines of the law become the standard of thought to mankind &#63; If
                human phi&#8211; losophy had perchance made the discovery of the Decalogue&#44; if
                by any possibility any one of the sages of <pb n="310"/> 310 THE PASSOVER
                CEREMONIES. antiquity had possessed himself of the mighty engine hy which more and
                more&#44; from age to age&#44; the human family has submitted itself to be governed
                &#58; he would doubtless have instituted especial guardians of the mighty
                mystery&#59; appointed a body of men who were alone intrusted with truths so
                profound&#44; who then could at pleasure have communicated their knowledge by slow
                degrees to their hearers&#59; and at length&#44; as everything human is liable to
                corruption&#44; designing successors might have added to it or diminished from the
                original truth&#44; and substituted such doctrines as comported best with their own
                political aggrandize&#8211; ment. What other method&#44; in fact&#44; could a man
                adopt &#63; how could he reach the ears of many except through many deputies &#63;
                how could he preserve his ideas except through faithful disciples&#63; how could
                they make themselves felt except through political influence &#63; And yet it must
                be clear to you&#44; that the masses could not thus be reached&#44; except by
                violent arbitrary restrictions&#44; or else by too slow degrees ever to be
                universally affected&#59; and suppose even that a whole people&#44; or&#44; say if
                you will&#44; many nations&#44; had become adherents to the new philosophy&#44; the
                effect of so much labour&#44; of so much time&#44; of so many hopes&#44; of so many
                cares&#44; must have been dissipated by the destruction of the political system to
                which it was necessarily united &#59; for there was or could be nothing in the
                foresight of man to bind the spirit&#44; when there was no longer a common outward
                symbol or political associations with which it was closely connected. Those
                acquainted with the history of nations can&#8211; easily cite examples for
                themselves&#59; but as it is not our province to make quotations from its pages&#44;
                we <pb n="311"/> THE PASSOVER CEREMONIES. 311 must content ourselves with mere
                allusions&#44; with the single assurance that the recorded facts amply bear out our
                assertions. If the Lord had acted now as man acts&#44; his religion would not have
                all at onee become the standard of a whole people&#59; mysteries&#44; learned
                castes&#44; exclusive knowledge&#44; confined to a limited number of priests&#44;
                are the very reverse of universal acquaintance with ideas&#59; and we have shown
                before this that it had necessarily been the design of the Most High to estab&#8211;
                lish a universal religion. How then should He do &#63; Should He proclaim abstract
                ideas merely &#63; Should He teach a pure philosophical system&#44; embracing the
                belief in one God&#44; the immortality of the soul&#44; ac&#8211; countability after
                death&#44; fraternal and neighbourly love&#44; filial obedience to parental
                authority &#63; Do you think that such a system could have stood for one
                generation&#44; at a time when the greatest sages believed in a multiplicity of
                gods&#59; when many had no concep&#8211; tion of anything but matter&#59; when
                artifice&#44; cunning and oppression were more practised than the kind&#8211; ness
                towards the neighbour&#44; which is the universal maxim of revealed religion&#63;

                of acts&#44; would necessarily have ensued. Let us&#44; therefore&#44; admire the
                wisdom of the Lord&#44; who&#44; by a simple contrivance&#44; which never could have
                proceeded from human intellect uninstructedby Him&#44; furnished the means of
                separating his chosen servants&#44; to whom lie had made known the truths which He
                contemplates to uphold&#44; so that they might be forever distinguished from all
                other nations by the belief in the unity of the Lord&#44; which they had received at
                their first coming out from Egypt. And this contrivance is the ceremonial law&#44;
                containing ordinances and rules of conduct&#44; which should be peculiarly the
                inheritance of Israel&#44; which should be the same in the infancy of their
                state&#44; when it was at the height of splendour&#44; and when the people should
                have been broken up as a nation&#44; and be wanderers in every land&#44; aliens in
                every country under the sun&#44; and then also when the light of freedom should
                shinti upon them in distant countries&#44; and they be members and citizens of
                com&#8211; munities&#44; the greater part of which do not accept the legislation of
                Sinai as their code of laws. We will confess that the ceremonies in themselves are
                of minor importance&#44; if compared with thegreat principle of our faith&#44; the
                belief in the Deity. But if we look upon them as emanations of this God&#44; as the
                declaration of his will&#44; as the means of effecting a high and holy end&#44; they
                are no longer unmeaning observances&#59; they rise into dignity&#44; they become
                equally important with the social duties&#59; they present themselves to us&#44; in

                sacrifices&#44; the temple&#8211;service&#44; and all those peculiar domestic rites
                and prohibitions which distinguish us from other nations. The first among the
                festivals is the weekly Sabbath. At a time when unmitigated tyranny was the lot of
                thousands of bondmen&#44; when their task was never ended&#44; when their toil
                terminated at the setting of the sun&#44; only to be resumed at his rising&#44;
                &#8212; this cere&#8211; monial institution at once bound the son of Israel to a
                peculiarity of conduct&#44; that he might have every week one day to think over the
                mighty work of the creation&#44; to impress on his mind the truth of the ex&#8211;
                istence of the Creator&#44; to remind him that he had been a slave in Egypt&#44; and
                to admonish him to have mercy on his bondman&#44; on him who from poverty or
                mis&#8211; fortune was compelled to seek service under his roof&#44; in his
                field&#44; or in his vineyard&#44; on him whom the fate of war had placed a captive
                under his absolute domin&#8211; ion&#44; on him in whose bosom the feeling of
                freedom had never found a home &#58; so that in all the land of Israel there might
                be a solemn universal rest&#44; when the task of the unfortunate should be
                ended&#44; when the master and his slave&#44; the victor and the captive&#44; the
                rich and the poor&#44; the joung and the old&#44; the king and the subject&#44;

                Power&#44; who had announced himself as the One&#44; the sole Creator and Ruler of
                the universe. The Sabbath was to be a part of the code by which a great truth should
                be perpetuated&#59; it was to be a characteristic of our race&#44; a weekly jubilee

                re&#8211; posed one day because it was the time devoted to God&#44; to worship and
                adore in his holy precincts. Next in order is the Passover&#44; the festival&#44;
                the recur&#8211; rence of which we celebrate at this season. When our fathers dwelt
                in Egypt&#44; they were subjected to all the maltreatment which arbitrary tyranny
                could invent&#59; children were snatched from tlie embrace of mothers&#44; ere yet
                their eyes had scanned the loved features of their tender offspring. Stripes were

                &#59; they laboured in works which brought them no <pb n="316"/> 316 THE
                I&#39;ASSOVER CEREMONIES. guin&#44; and tilled fields from the produce of which they
                might not eat. Chiefs of their tribes&#44; no less than ordinary men&#44; were
                subject to the same indignities&#44; and all were alike in the common degradation
                which had overwhelmed the children of Jacob. It was then that the Lord of Justice
                appeared in his. glory&#44; de&#8211; manding the liberation of the children of his
                adorer&#59; and when his power was denied hy the oppressor&#44; He made himself
                manifest by deeds which the Supreme alone could produce&#44; and the chains of the
                captives were broken&#44; the haughty were humbled to the dust&#44; and the shores
                of the Arabian Gulf resounded with the song of triumph of thankful redeemed tens of
                thousands. To keep this event fresh in the memory of all who claim their descent
                from Israel&#44; particular ceremonies were instituted&#44; calculated from their
                very peculiarity to arrest the attention of the young&#44; and to induce them to
                inquire of their sires for the mean&#8211; ing of what they see. In the times when
                Moriah&#39;s hill was crowned with the glorious structure to which our tribes did
                flock at all the festive seasons&#44; the sacri&#8211; ficial lamb was slain as at
                the first celebration of their anticipated redemption. But now&#44; when our sins
                have deprived us of this common home&#44; we yet keep the commemoration&#44; though
                in less splendour than in days of old. Still oven now there are many things in a
                proper Jewish household&#44; as the preparatory jiuri&#8211; fieations&#44; the
                baking of the unleavened bread&#44; the or&#8211; der of the domestic celebration
                wherein old and young should join&#44; and the assembling at the houses of prayer to
                thank again and again the Lord&#44; because that lie is good and that His mercy
                endureth forever&#44; to in&#8211; duce the intelligent child to ask of his
                parents&#44; &#34; What <pb n="317"/> THE PASSOVER CEREMONIES. 317 mean you by this
                service &#63;&#34; and well may they an&#8211; swer&#58; &#34;It is a sacrifice of
                the Lord&#39;s Passover&#44; who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in
                Egypt&#44; when He smote the Egyptians and delivered our houses.&#34; For in truth
                all the ceremonies which we yet observe are the legitimate remainder of the
                institutions which were first given to us &#59; they are the sacrifices which Israel
                bring in captivity&#44; and they take place to remind ourselves of the debt of
                grati&#8211; tude which we owe to the Lord&#44; inasmuch as He saved us from
                annihilation when the pestilence stalked abroad in Egypt&#44; and brought us forth
                from slavery unto an everlasting freedom. Did time permit&#44; we might enumerate
                many other observances&#44; and prove their intimate relation with the
                well&#8211;being of Israel. But we must defer the greater part to another occasion.
                Yet this much will appear from what has been said already&#44; that cere&#8211;
                monies&#44; as such&#44; have a powerful influence in arrest&#8211; ing the
                attention and exciting inquiry. They are eminently calculated to call forth the
                energies of the youthful especially&#44; to seek for light from those who are
                already acquainted with their belief&#44; and to com&#8211; pel these&#44; if they
                would wish to be proper guides to their juniors&#44; to apply themselves to the
                study of the Law&#44; in order to answer them understandingly when appealed to for
                instruction. This was&#44; as we stated at first&#44; the instrument of Deity to
                perpetuate the Law. He foresaw that&#44; though we were a united people when He
                spoke to us on Sinai&#44; vicissitudes would arise which must necessarily try the
                power of resistance&#44; which we could bring to oppose the as&#8211; saults of
                adverse circumstances. Many of these oc&#8211; 27&#42; <pb n="318"/> 318 THE
                PASSOVER CEREMONIES. curred already during our residence in Palestine&#44; partially
                through our intercourse with the heathens&#44; but more yet through the inborn
                sinfuhiess of the human heart&#59; still many others were the peculiar offspring of
                the state of our dispersion&#44; which dis&#8211; solved that national union wliicli
                had united us to&#8211; gether in more peaceful and Ijappier days. The Lord
                therefore bound the truth of his law not to images&#44; not to statuary&#44; not to
                the magnificent temples&#44; not to splendid processions&#44; but to simple
                every&#8211;day prac&#8211; tices&#44; which were to mingle themselves with almost
                every act of the Israelite&#44; which were to pervade every day of his life and
                accompany him in death. It was not by confiding the truth to a select few&#44; by
                which it was to be preserved &#59; not by constituting a priesthood the guardian of
                the sacred treasure&#44; that it was to be shielded from the assault of every
                ad&#8211; verse circumstance to which the people might be ex&#8211; posed&#59; but
                by constituting the whole nation this cus&#8211; todian&#44; by rendering them
                acquainted Avith many acts of worship which were all to refer to the great truth of
                the omnipotence of their Redeemer. More&#8211; over&#44; it was necessary to prevent
                the mingling of this priestly people with those around them&#44; for fear lest the
                small number of believers might at last be totally swallowed up among those who were
                in error. The Law&#44; therefore&#44; was magnified by numerous family&#8211;
                regulations&#44; all calculated to cause Israel to dwell se&#8211; curely&#44; and
                not to be numbered among the nations. &#34;When we cannot mingle with our gentile

                Everlasting Father &#33; how wonderful are thy ways&#44; and how highly art Thou
                exalted above all that exists&#33; If we cast our eyes to heaven&#44; we there see
                Thee dis&#8211; played in the myriads of shining lights that are fixed in the
                immensity of space&#44; in the softly beaming moon&#44; and in the brilliant sun
                which quickens all below by his warming rays. If we descend to the earth&#8212; the
                planet surrendered to us for our dwelling &#8212; we see Thee&#44; we feel thy
                presence and power in the infinite variety of organization which everywhere meets
                our view. And who knows not&#44; our God&#33; that by thy will alone the river
                rushes onward in its course to mingle with the mighty waves of the boundless ocean
                &#63; Who feels not that&#44; by Thee directed&#44; the refreshing breeze and the
                fearfnl storm are sent on their errands of love or wrath &#63; And when the wintry
                snows are spread over the landscape&#44; or when&#44; amidst the thick Ibliage of
                vernal trees&#44; every bird sings forth in har&#8211; mony its Maker&#39;s
                praise&#44; who feels not that thy power guides and blesses all&#63; And Avhen we
                turn our view within us&#44; and experience the happiness of a sentient soul&#44;
                and are made conscious that we have a law from Thee which will ever point out the

                days gone by&#44; stood forward as the guides of their associates &#8212; who taught
                the law without price or hope of reward &#8212; and who not un&#8211; frequently
                incurred the greatest personal risks&#44; even to the very loss of life itself&#44;
                in the discharge of their assumed duties&#44; have left us many beautiful and sage
                aphorisms&#44; than which nothing truer is discoverable in the writings of the great
                names of any other nation. Without&#44; however&#44; doing more to&#8211;day than
                merely adverting to this indisputable fact&#44; we will call your attention to one
                saying of the pre&#8211;eminently pious Rabbi Akiba&#44; wdiose happy lot it was to
                exliibit in his own resignation under the tortures he endured for the public
                teaching of his Master&#39;s commandment in opposition to the mandate of a heathen
                tyrant&#44; that the blessed faith that was in him could rise trium&#8211; phant
                even above the pangs of death&#44; and place him worthily amidst the bright galaxy
                of the great ones to whom the glory of the Lord had in former years been revealed.
                These are his words &#58; &#34; He &#40;Rabbi Akiba used to say&#44; Man is surely
                dear to God&#44; be&#8211; cause lie created him in his image&#59; but an
                addi&#8211; <pb n="323"/> THE CHOSEN PEOPLE OF GOD. 323 tional evidence of love it
                is that it was made known to him&#44; that he was created in the image of God&#44;
                he&#8211; cause it is said&#44; &#39; For in the image of God did He make man.&#39;
                The Israelites are dear to God&#44; because they are called children of the Lord
                &#59; but an additional evidence of love it is that it was made known to them&#44;
                that they are called children unto the Lord&#59; for it is said&#44; &#39; You are
                children unto the Lord your God.&#39; &#34; And he then continues &#58; &#34;The
                Israelites are dear&#44; because there has been given to them that precious ornament
                in which the world was created&#59; but it is an additional evidence of love that
                this was made known to them &#59; for it is said &#58;&#39; A good instruction I
                have given you&#44; forsake ye not my law.&#39; &#34; Aboth iii. 18. The learned
                Rabbi presents us a threefold cause of gratitude by which every individual Israelite
                is bound to his Maker. In the first instance&#44; we are called on to reflect on the
                overflowing goodness of the Lord&#44; inasmuch as He bestowed on a creature&#44;
                perish&#8211; able from the nature of its material composition&#44; an intelligent
                spirit&#44; a part&#44; as it were&#44; of his own essence. Let it be ever before
                our minds&#44; permanently im&#8211;&#39; pressed upon our soul&#44; that we have
                received an ex&#8211; istence more exalted&#44; more refined&#44; more
                endurino&#8211;&#44; than has been vouchsafed to any other earthly crea&#8211; ture.
                We stand not alone erect in the sight of Heaven &#59; <pb n="324"/> 324 THE CHOSEN
                PEOPLE OF GOD. we not only turn upward our gaze to the starry firma&#8211; ment
                studded Avith its millions of suns&#44; and planets on planets &#59; but we do more
                &#8212; we turn our look from these high objects to the laws which govern them&#59;
                we trace them from their rising to their setting&#44; and note their course with the
                astounding accuracy of ma&#8211; thematical investigation&#59; we enjoy already in
                antici&#8211; pation their regular reappearance at their appointed stations&#44; and
                fearlessly venture on the trackless ocean&#44; shown on our way by their wonderful
                instruction. Indeed&#44; it is not the mere superior animal outline which
                constitutes us men&#44; made in the image of God&#44; but the intellect&#44; which
                makes this miraculously formed frame of real benelit to the possessor and to others.
                In looking at the beast&#44; we never find that its care extends farther than to its
                own preservation and the early support of its young&#59; for even these are
                abandoned to themselves so soon as they are able to provide for their own wants. But
                man&#44; made in the image of God&#44; extends the fruits of his benevolence to all
                who approach his sphere&#44; unless he is brutally dead to the call of natural
                benevolence within him&#44; and lays up treasures&#44; mental no less than
                physical&#44; for the benefit of his offspring&#44; though they no longer require
                his immediate care to supply themselves with food. Reason alone&#44; the gift of the
                Lord&#44; thus already points out to us our degree of belovedness in the eyes of our
                Maker. But&#44; says the moralist&#44; we can dis&#8211; cover an additional
                evidence of love in the fact that we are certified by Holy Writ of our exalted
                con&#8211; dition. For powerful as human reason is to guide us aright in our
                investigations&#44; far&#8211;reaching as is our intellect in elucidating the
                mysteries of outward ua&#8211; <pb n="325"/> THE CHOSEN PEOPLE OF GOD. 325 ture&#44;

                not thereby enabled to know with precision what are the thoughts and wishes of our
                Creator. But if Holy Writ steps in and assists us in our inves&#8211; tigations&#44;
                uncertainty at once vanishes&#44; and we are brought into the very counsel of our
                ever&#8211;living Fa&#8211; ther &#8212; we see Him as He is&#44; not as our misled
                fancy might arbitrarily paint Him&#59; and if then our reason&#44; in assigning to
                man the pre&#8211;eminence in creation&#44; is aided by the express words of the
                Lord&#44; satisfying us that He made us in his spiritual image&#44; we may freely
                cease our investigations&#44; the inquiry is fully answered&#44; and&#44; without
                presumption or overweening pride&#44; we may claim for ourselves the possession of
                the divine image&#44; and that we must be dear to God&#44; because we were so
                created&#44; and because we were so instructed in the holy Book which was given for
                our guidance. But this beloved being&#44; this child of earth tilled with the image
                divine&#44; must needs feel drawn to the Source from which he sprang by the
                strongest ties of kindred&#44; of filial love&#44; of dutiful obedience&#59; and he
                ought to omit no occasion&#44; from the dawning of his intellect till his returning
                to his Father by the portals of death&#44; to offer thanks and devotion for the many
                benefits which are hourly heaped upon him&#44; and to regard&#44; with the eye of
                humble adoration&#44; the many and&#44; in fact&#44; innumerable things&#44; all

                and equally with him heirs to the bounteous table so liberally spread for all by the

                state of society around us&#44; of the dreadful degradation then almost universal.
                Xo written word of God was then in existence&#44; at least no record has come down
                to us to prove that there was a written revelation universally spread among men&#59;

                generations&#44; were already fast falling into oblivion&#44; and making way to the
                spread of irreligion <pb n="327"/> THE CHOSEN PEOPLE OF GOD. 327 and idolatiy&#59;
                and the universal speech which be&#8211; longed to all men immediately after the
                flood had already yielded to the multiplicity of dialects&#44; by which the
                transmission of truth became greatly im&#8211; peded. Tyrants&#44; too&#44; had
                already usurped the place of authority in many countries&#59; and with the de&#8211;
                cay of the worship of the Eternal&#44; the freedom of man was fast flying aflrighted
                before the power of superstition and tyranny. It was then that the be&#8211; loved
                of the Lord grasped hold of the everlasting truth of the existence of one
                Supreme&#44; who is alone the Eternal&#44; and spread tliis sublime doctrine amidst
                benighted nations&#59; and though we do not find it re&#8211; corded that many
                converts embraced his faith&#44; we are&#44; nevertheless&#44; certain that his
                mission opposed a mighty barrier to the spread of error&#44; which other&#8211; wise
                might have become universal. The descendants of this great man were naturally&#44;
                like him&#44; worship&#8211; pers of the one God&#44; and as they had peculiar
                rites&#44; and as an initiation was required for all who entered into their
                confederacy for the upholding of the truth as they had received it&#44; they
                were&#44; without a great stretch of the imagination&#44; called children unto the
                Most High&#44; they being men who worshipped not a multitude of deities&#44; but the
                Creator alone&#44; whom they professed to recognize in all tlie objects which
                administered to their wants or pleasures. But a renewed cause for assuming this
                title was given them in their preserva&#8211; tion during a long servitude in
                Egypt&#59; for though they were subjected to the most rigorous labour&#44; and the
                most grinding oppression&#44; and the most wanton slaughter&#44; they lost not
                altogether the knowledge of their ancestral God&#44; and directed to Him their
                prayers <pb n="328"/> 328 THE CHOSEN PEOPLE OF GOD. for deliverance and enlargement.
                And their prayers were heard&#59; and they were led forth from their chains&#44; not
                as a multitude of slaves&#44; not as barbarians&#44; with&#8211; out a national name
                or ancestral reputation&#44; but as the nation of Israelites&#44; as descendants
                from the great&#8211; est names of antiquity&#44; as heirs of the knowdedge of the
                existence of the only true God. Were they not then children unto the Lord&#63; Would
                not reason&#44; their own conviction&#44; have taught them this&#63; But again does
                prophecy step in to make us feel secure that our reasonable conviction is just and
                proper. God&#44; in his holy Word&#44; especially certifies us that indeed lie looks
                upon us as his sons. Yes&#44; every individual Israelite is a special object of his
                care&#44; inasmuch and wdienever he observes the duties of gratitude&#44; of
                love&#44; of obedience in his intercourse with his Almighty Father&#44; who will
                surely protect and bless him wdienever his care is sincerely invoked. We are&#44;
                therefore&#44; fully justified in returning tlianks to God for our selection&#44; as
                we do in our prayers&#58; &#34;Thou hast chosen us from all people&#59; Thou hast
                loved and favoured us&#44; and exalted us above all tongues&#44; and sanctified us
                with thy commandments&#44; and brought us near unto thy service&#44; our King&#33;
                and hast called us by thy great and holy Name&#59;&#34; &#8212; but not to exalt
                ourselves above the rest of mankind&#44; to esteem ourselves better and wiser than
                other na&#8211; tions&#44; only to prove our superiority by acting as be&#8211;
                comes persons whose lot is so beautiful&#44; to show our&#8211; selves worthy to be
                indeed called the people whose God is the Lord. Let us understand well&#44; that the
                ideas which a peopl entertain of the Deity naturally affect their general conduct as
                well as their mode of <pb n="329"/> THE CHOSEN PEOPLE OF GOD. 329 thinking. If&#44;
                therefore&#44; a mean and degrading con&#8211; ception of the First Cause should
                unfortunately be the lot of any nation&#44; so in proportion will its
                intellect&#8211; ual capacity and morals sink down below the exalted level of
                religious enlightenment&#59; and in tlie same measure as a nation rises into a
                better appreciation of the nature of God &#40;to use an almost profane ex&#8211;
                pression&#44; so will also its intellect and morals im&#8211; prove. And we may
                maintain that&#44; with the highest ac&#8211; knowledgment&#44; the brightest
                conception of his being&#44; which characterize the people of Israel&#44; are
                insepara&#8211; bly connected the clearest appreciation of our duties&#44; and the
                most enlightened conception of nature and its results&#59; and that as a people
                recede from our stand&#8211; ard of religious recognition of the Lord&#44; so must
                they fall behind us in the realization of truths and capacity for moral worth&#44;
                which are far more valuable than the acquisition of certain sciences and physical
                improvements&#44; in which many people&#44; we will grant for argument&#39;s
                sake&#44; have made greater advances than the Israelites. Admitting this&#44;
                however&#44; it does not prove any absolute inferiority on our part&#44; or an
                in&#8211; capacity for acquiring an equal degree of excellence in the practical
                sciences and arts&#44; compared with any other part of mankind&#44; whilst as yet no
                class of men has attained to a proper participation in our own received views of the

                unwilling to submit our will to the arbitrement of our Father in heaven&#44; and

                valued it&#44; every recess&#44; nay&#44; the dark&#8211; est hours of our whole
                existence. O &#33; if we would only be obedient to our Benefactor&#44; and approach
                Him with childlike confidence in every hour of life&#44; mid joy and mid sorrow&#44;
                mid glory and mid shame&#44; how tranquilly would our existence glide along&#44;
                un&#8211; til the current of our earthly career&#44; the tumultuous rush of the
                stream of cares and tribulation&#44; should serenely mingle with the fearful wastes
                of the ocean of eternity&#44; which would bear us then onward in bliss&#8211; ful
                calm and serenity&#44; to the mansion of our immortal Parent&#44; the God of all
                flesh&#44; the Lord of all spirits. &#34; The Israelites are dear&#44; because there
                has been given to them that precious ornament in which the world was created.&#34;
                If the Lord had merely re&#8211; deemed us&#44; because of his covenant with our
                fore&#8211; fathers&#44; from the thraldom of Mitzrayim&#39;s kings&#44; we would
                have had little permanent cause to be distin&#8211; guished above the gentiles&#59;
                because the corruption engendered by a long course of oppression had hard&#8211;
                ened our mind&#44; and rendered us not much elevated above them in religious
                knowledge&#44; although the whole of the ancestral traditions&#44; as said already
                had not been forgotten&#44; whilst we were undoubtedly be&#8211; neath our rulers in
                the arts and elegancies of life. But the Merciful One would not redeem us to mock us
                with a useless freedom&#44; which would soon have mingled us again with the nations
                among whom we <pb n="331"/> THE CHOSEN PEOPLE OF GOD. 331 would have taken np our

                us forth unto the Mount of God&#44; even the blessed Sinai&#44; and from its summit
                announced to us laws&#44; holy and imperishable as is their Author&#44; whose word
                is unchangeable&#44; and whose seal is truth. But what is this law&#63; It is the
                principle of universal justice and love. It is the jewel for which&#44; and in
                which&#44; the world was created. Think you that aught but justice and love are the
                principles which govern the Creator&#63; Believe you that the least approach of
                caprice and malevolence finds a place in his counsel &#63; If so you think and
                believe&#44; little can you boast of a knowledge of the Most Holy. He should be
                unjust&#63; He not loving every creature &#63; He wavering in his purpose &#63; He
                listening to the breathings of hate and anger&#63; No&#44; no &#33; not so is our
                God&#44; &#8212; not thus do we recognize Him who has made us for our happiness and
                his glory. &#34; The dead cannot praise the Lord&#44; &#34; says the Psalmist. It is
                the living who can contem&#8211; plate his wonders and spread the fame of his
                mercies. It is life&#44; therefore&#44; He desires&#44; and it is mercy&#44;
                truth&#44; and love He means to spread forth over the earth&#44; even when&#44; to
                our imperfect vision&#44; we fancy for a moment that his face is hidden&#44; and
                clouds obscure the sunshine of his favour. Now&#44; even as He is him&#8211; self
                loving and preserving all&#44; so must needs be his Word&#59; for we could not call
                Him all&#8211;perfect&#44; if his laws were calculated to promote hatred&#44;
                malevolence&#44; and oppression &#59; or if their observance could in any manner

                the mind with superstitious terrors and groundless appreciation of things which&#44;
                from their nature&#44; can have no existence in reality. Yes&#44; if we investigate
                the divine law which Israel has re&#8211; ceived&#44; when thcy stood with their
                thousands and tens of thousands&#44; with their children and their old men&#44; with
                their chiefs and the newly admitted stranger&#44; at the foot of Horeb&#44; on the
                day of the as&#8211; sembling&#44; we will discover nothing which bears not the
                stamp of the highest wisdom and practical utility. True&#44; crimes are
                denounced&#44; and meet punishments laid down for the transgressors&#59; yet&#44;
                what is that but a due care for the welfare of the entire body politic&#63; Is it
                mercy to let crimes take deep root and poison the vitals of society &#63; Is it
                justice to let the criminal escape&#44; from a false feeling of compassion&#44;
                unwhipt of justice&#44; and so render him prepared&#44; by his impuni&#8211; ty&#44;
                for the commission of other crimes &#63; If the mercy which the world requires were
                needed for transgres&#8211; sors alone&#44; then indeed might you call it justice to
                have regard to those who have set the laws at defi&#8211; ance &#59; but common
                sense teaches us&#44; and we need no revelation for this&#44; that mercy&#44;
                misapplied&#44; shown to the wicked&#44; is an injury inflicted upon the peaceable
                and unofiending members of the community&#59; and if tlio law does not avenge the
                wrongs done to individ&#8211; uals as ofiences against the community&#44;
                individuals will be compelled to right themselves by acts of vio&#8211; lence&#44;
                or by precautionary means&#44; even to the shed&#8211; ding of the blood of a
                ruthless aggressor. If then <pb n="333"/> THE CHOSEN PEOPLE OF GOD. 333 you seek for
                too great leniency as an evidence of its mildness in the law of Moses&#44; you will
                be disap&#8211; pointed. It promises no immunity to the sinner. But if you wish to
                see laws which can protect the in&#8211; nocent&#44; and even the guilty&#44; till

                institutions&#44; which can compel the evil&#8211;disposed to regard the sacred
                rights of others&#58; then come to the house of Israel&#44; and study with
                pro&#8211; found respect the code of Moses&#59; for there you will meet with
                precisely such ordinances as will secure you in the enjoyment of your own
                rights&#44; whilst they will admonish you to hold sacred and invite the rights and
                feelings of others. In this sense&#44; there&#8211; fore&#44; is our code eminently
                conservative of the peace and happiness of the world&#44; &#8212; in fact&#44; a
                precious or&#8211; nament to all who seek its instruction. But we may extend our
                inquiry&#44; and regard its bearing upon the mind of man&#44; in the abstract&#44;
                without connecting him with the mass of his fellow&#8211;men around him. Let us
                understand that we have a twofold existence &#8212; a social and an individual. In
                the first capacity&#44; we have duties to execute and protection to receive&#59;
                that is&#44; we are bound to perform a number of acts&#44; such as contributing to
                the public burdens&#44; protecting with our means and life the rights and liberties
                of our country&#44; pursuing some occupation that we may not become burdensome to
                others&#44; giving charity to the needy&#44; and similar other acts&#44; for which
                Ave in return can justly claim analogous deeds of mercy from oui neighbours and
                society at large &#59; for the state is bound to see that its citizens suffer no

                enemies &#59; and wlien we are needy&#44; we have well&#8211;founded claims upon the
                assistance and charities of all who have the means to assist and to bestow. But ill
                our individual existence&#44; there are quite other relations with which society has
                properly no concern &#59; but then even&#44; as isolated beings&#44; we have an
                intimate relation to our Maker&#44; whose crea&#8211; tures we are. It is
                proper&#44; therefore&#44; that&#44; in a wise code of laws&#44; there be at least
                some regulations which look towards the relations of man to God&#44; which will give
                him some insight into the attributes of the Su&#8211; preme Father&#44; and afford
                him some hints how he can make himself acceptable to this infinite Being&#44; with
                this sole limitation&#44; that the doctrinal part should be worthy of the
                exaltedness of the Creator&#44; and the du&#8211; ties not to be degrading to the
                intellect of man. And precisely this we find again accomplished in the law of Moses.
                Of God&#39;s attributes we have received such information&#44; that no human
                ingenuity can add aught to their sublimity and force &#59; and the duties are of
                that kind&#44; that no man can ever say that his intellect is degraded whilst
                worshipping the Lord after our manner&#44; or that the details are too difficult for
                his attainment. Of tlie attributes of the Creator we liave the fol&#8211; lowing
                revelation in answer to the request of Moses&#44; to be made acquainted with the
                Almighty&#39;s ways &#58; &#34; The Lord is the immutable and eternal Being&#59; an

                self&#8211; evident a proposition&#44; you cannot imagine God to be otherwise than

                these cases you will find that the most exalted conceptions which a human philosophy
                could by any possibility arrive at after ages of anxious reflection and inquiry&#44;
                have all been long since anticipated by the simple revela&#8211; tion of that
                blessed Book with which you have been lainihar from infancy. And as regards the
                duties&#44; they are comprised mainly in the Ten Command&#8211; ments&#44; which we
                have read this day in commemora&#8211; tion of their public announcement from Horeb
                and are summed up in the two main ordinances&#58; &#34;And thou Shalt love the Lord

                PEOPLE OF GOD. must come to the conclusion that&#44; were it not for the principles
                of eternal justice revealed in bis law&#44; and for the certainty that these
                principles would one day be universally adopted as the laws of mankind&#44; this

                discoverable in the whole uni&#8211; verse would have been interrupted by the want
                of order and justice on earth. We must&#44; therefore&#44; come to the
                conclusion&#44; that the universal prevalence of the divine law was the primary
                object of the crea&#8211; tion &#59; and that all the stages of society existing
                pre&#8211; vious to this happy reign of truth are merely prelim&#8211; inary&#44; as
                was the slavery of the Israelites their initia&#8211; tion to their receiving the
                heavenly laws on the great day of the evident descent of God&#39;s glory before the
                eyes of an assembled people. IIow great must then be the love of the Lord for his
                chosen people&#44; that lie was pleased to appoint them guardians of this pre&#8211;
                cious treasure &#33; a treasure not counterbalanced by any earthly riches or
                glory&#59; a treasure of knowledge and truth&#44; which philosophers and deeply
                learned men ever failed of obtaining. And can we be indif&#8211; ferent to its
                value&#63; Shall all the world seek its light&#44; and Israel cast it off as a thing
                of no value &#63; Let us hope that we&#44; the descendants of Abraham&#44; will know

                arrive&#44; which God in his mercy forfeud&#44; when Israel will be tired of bearing

                glory which enveloped the summit of Smai. But such a day can never arise. There are

                the true and holy God. And how can it be otherwise &#63; Not alone that the law was
                given to us&#44; we are again and again reminded that we are in possession of this
                great blessing&#59; and God not only revealed himself in the days of Moses&#44; but

                to the ancient covenant&#44; and asked of us to remain true and steadfast to Him and

                GOD OUR ATONEMENT&#44; DISCOURSE XXIV. GOD OUR ATONEMENT. No. I. O Hope of
                Israel&#44; who art ready to hear and to save in all times of trouble and affliction
                &#33; regard not our sinful state&#44; and condemn us not though our iniquities
                testify against us. The creatures of circumstances&#44; the fading flowers of the
                day&#44; Ave are lured upon by&#8211; paths&#44; and we stray perpetually from the
                road which leads to thy rest. But salvation is with thee&#44; Father&#33; and mercy
                is thine&#44; and kindness and truth are the seal of thy excellency. Act then toward
                us according to thy wont&#44; and cleanse us from our transgressions&#44; and
                sprinkle on us the waters of purification&#44; even thy grace&#44; which is poured
                out over the whole world&#44; and which invites every one who is unclean to come and
                be purified&#44; and which calls on all who are laden with guilt to throw their
                burden on Thee&#44; O God &#33; and Thou proniisest to relieve them of their
                sorrow&#44; to rekindle in them thy holy spirit&#44; and to remove the heart of
                stone which is obdurate against thy goodness&#44; and which refuses to see Thee&#44;
                although in all the world thy being is manifest&#44; governing with benefi&#8211;
                cence&#44; and illuminating all with thy wisdom. Cause us&#44; then&#44; to feel
                truly the forgiveness of our misdeeds&#44; let us be conscious that we are
                reconciled to Thee&#44; and let the nations see that our hope was not in vain&#44;

                they may understand how Thou alone art the Xiawgiver&#44; Thou alone the Ruler&#44;
                and Thou alone the Pardoner of sins&#59; and that as no stranger o&#8211;od was with
                thee when Thou didst stretch forth the firmament like a curtain&#44; and when thy
                voice spoke in the thunders of Horeb&#44; so art Thou the sole Ref&#8211; uge for
                the transgressor&#44; and that Thou alone blessest the just and redeemest the erring
                mortal. And thus shall thy ISTame be sanctified in all the world&#44; and all men
                worship thee&#44; O Fountain of Purity &#33; forever. Amen&#44; Brethren &#33; In
                general it may be asserted that controversial sermons are not agreeable to an
                audience who are more interested in some historical or admonitory ad&#8211;
                dress&#44; and who may imagine that controversy should be avoided&#44; for fear of
                giving just cause of oftencc to our friendly neighbours&#44; wdio might deem
                themselves aggrieved should they in our assemblies have to listen to direct attacks
                on what they hold sacred. Though agreeing in general with these views&#44; I cannot
                consent to banish from our synagogues the discussion of purely Jewish matters&#44;
                though they may come in con&#8211; flict with the ideas of our neighbours&#44; and
                are not well calculated for oratorical displays and fine phrase&#8211; ology. Nor
                can I think that any oflience can be taken if we temperately discuss our own views
                in our as&#8211; semblies&#59; as the object is not to attack others&#44; but merely
                to give our own people some means of reply&#8211; ing to assaults on their
                religion&#44; to which they are so constantly exposed. If&#44; indeed&#44; we were
                so numerous 29&#42; <pb n="342"/> 342 GOD OUR ATONEMENT. that our opinions were
                backed by the public voice&#59; if we could in a measure coerce the inditi&#39;crent
                to profess a veneration for our religion by the indignant frown of the majority
                &#58; then&#44; indeed&#44; might it bo pos&#8211; sible for the pulpit to confine
                itself to appeals&#44; and if you will&#44; to persuasions and denunciations. But
                un&#8211; fortunately this is not the case&#59; we are but a handful amidst the vast
                masses which surround us&#59; public opinion&#44; if not against the morality of our
                faith&#44; is certainly against our doctrinal views and ceremonial practices &#59;
                denunciations&#44; as fierce&#44; or fiercer than any Jewish minister can frame&#44;
                are hurled constantly&#44; even in our hearing&#44; against all those who adopt not
                the opinions of the majority. All this makes it evi&#8211; dent that the mind of our
                younger persons&#44; especially those who are thrown into general society&#44; ought
                to be fortified with some sound reasoning when they are asked for the cause of their
                a&#44; biding by their fiiith&#44; and not merely assign as their sole motive that
                their fathers had been Jews before them. This&#44; indeed&#44; is a good reason as
                far as it goes. It shows in the one who urges it that he feels a sincere regard for
                his progeni&#8211; tors&#44; whom&#44; both by law and his own impulse&#44; he is
                bound to love &#59; but it is not satisfactory to the in&#8211; quirers&#44; nor
                will it stand the assault of temptation when interest and inclination point one
                way&#44; whilst the parental admonitions lift up but a feeble warning voice amidst
                the tumult of passion. It is&#44; therefore&#44; but proper that those who arc
                called upon to address the people should&#44; whilst admonishing them&#44; also
                en&#8211; deavour to prove&#44; occasionally&#44; the superiority of our religion
                &#59; and if this should assume the appearance of a controversial address&#44; it
                can of right not be laid <pb n="343"/> GOD OUR ATONEMENT. 343 as a charge of
                wrongdoing against them. But let us drop this introduction&#44; which&#44;
                perhaps&#44; was unneces&#8211; sary and was merely pat forward to answer any
                ob&#8211; jection which may have been made against many of the addresses which it
                has been my province to lay before you from time to time. The object of all religion
                is professedly tlie welfare of mankind&#44; and however absurd his dogmas and cruel
                his practices&#44; no priest did ever aver that he was an enemy to his species. The
                very persecutions which we had to endure from the cruellest of all tyrannies&#44;
                the Romish Inquisition&#44; were professedly contrived for the salvation of our
                souls&#59; only that we could not recognize in the butcheries of millions of
                innocents anything except the basest superstition&#44; acting&#44; if they were
                honest&#44; upon weak and excited imaginations. And to this day every absurdity and
                every trifling hair&#8211; splitting invented to torment the human understand&#8211;
                ina&#58;&#44; which are ofiered in the name of the most sacred gift of the Most High
                &#8212; religion &#8212; are all based&#44; as their defenders pretend&#44; on the
                welfare of mankind &#59; and thus the &#8211;superficial might think all systems of
                equal value&#44; or of no value at all&#44; and adopt the first that is ofifered to
                him&#44; in case he felt that he required some&#8211; thing more than mere dry
                morality in his self&#8211;govern&#8211; ment. Every rational being&#44;
                however&#44; ought to have some cogent reason why he professes a certain faith&#44;
                unless he would subject himself to the charge of be&#8211; lieving blindly&#44; and
                of folio wing that of which he has no definite idea himself. Still is this
                proceeding too often met with&#59; since men will follow a certain lead without
                exactly knowing why&#44; and they often fancy that the greater their ignorance the
                greater is the <pb n="344"/> 344 GOD OUR ATONEMENT. merit of tlicir faith&#44; as
                they term it&#44; as thougli the Ahuighty had given us an understanding&#44; which
                may be exercised in all pursuits and in every scientific in&#8211; quiry with the
                sole exception of religion. This will give us now the following results&#58;
                first&#44; that it is not a matter of indifference what religion we profess&#59; and
                that secondly&#44; mere believing without inquiry can&#8211; not be in accordance
                with the intention of God&#44; who endowed us with intellect&#59; and that hence
                absurdities caunot be defended on the sole plea that they are cal&#8211; culated for
                the good of mankind. It is not our business to refer to the systems which are lost
                in antiquity&#44; or which are removed from us by distance&#44; or professed by the
                unenlightened&#59; for no one asks us to become Greek&#44; Hindoo&#44; or Shaman. We
                are ouly told by our enlightened neighbours that we are in error&#44; because we
                profess to follow Moses&#39;s teaching instead of the doctrines of one they call a
                greater prophet than Moses. It is not my intention at present to examine into his
                claim to be received by us &#59; as I only mean to confine myself to the peculiar
                religious idea which is preached up in his name&#44; and to enforce which millions
                of Jewish souls have ascended to heaven denying it emphatically&#44; from the
                burning stake&#44; the bloody scaffold&#44; the surging wave&#44; and the
                ignominious gibbet. Every one who thinks must be startled with the lact of the great
                opposition of Israel&#8211; ites to the spread of the Nazarene creed&#44; and he
                must admit&#44; at the same time&#44; that had it not been for a great principle at
                stake in the contest&#44; the self&#8211;sacrifice of our brothers would have been
                madness&#44; suicide&#44; self&#8211;delusion&#44; and not heroism&#44; not an act

                God should clmnge&#44; should be false to his word&#44; and vacillating in his
                purpose. It was for this they were driven forth&#44; for this they were
                unpitied&#44; for this they were scorned &#58; and do you call them fanatics&#63; do
                you believe them mistaken in their line of duty &#63; when a word spoken would have
                placed them above danger&#63; high in the estimation of the worhl &#63; There
                is&#44; therefore&#44; evidently something which the Israelite avers&#44; for which
                he lives&#44; for which he is willing to die&#44; which the Nazarenes&#44; for it is
                of them I speak&#44; deem erroneous&#44; and the contrary of which they have
                endeavoured to propagate and enforce&#44; during the past eighteen centuries&#44;
                pending all which time the other had nothing to oppose but an un&#8211; daunted
                courage&#44; an inflexible obstinacy&#44; if you will call it so&#44; which
                nevertheless was the very means best calculated to overcome the danger of
                annihilation which threatened him&#44; and to extort the admiration of his
                tormentors. And yet&#44; it is from the same source that both parties endeavour to
                fortify their faith&#59; it is the sacred Scriptures which both appeal to in
                justification of their opinions. We have&#44; there&#8211; fore&#44; a common medium
                to consult&#44; and the umpire to decide with whom is the best of the argument&#44;
                must be the reason with which we are endowed&#44; the light of the spirit which the
                Creator himself has kin&#8211; dled within each breast. Let us then see what is the
                principal point of faith about which we contend&#44; and then apply Scripture to its
                elucidation. The Naza&#8211; <pb n="347"/> GOD OUR ATONEMENT. 347 rene being the
                claimant of a new revelation&#44; must sj3eak first&#44; we will give bini the
                precedence &#58; he then says&#44; that man in sinning has no means of
                salvation&#44; that inexorable jnstice demands a sacrifice&#59; that in the first
                man&#44; Adam&#44; all his descendants had sinned past redemption&#44; and that it
                required a new creation&#44; a being unlike any other tliat ever lived&#44; created
                though not created&#44; man though not man&#44; mortal though not mortal&#44; a
                servant of God&#44; though God himself&#44; to assume the sin of Adam and all
                mankind&#44; and to atone for them to the Creator by liis voluntary death. The
                Israelite denies all this&#59; he says that man&#44; though he sins&#44; is not past
                redemption&#59; that a sacrifice is not absolutely required for the atonement of sin
                &#59; that in Adam&#39;s fall all mankind did not lose their immortal salvation&#44;
                and that nosuch being as is alleged to have come&#44; did come into the world&#59;
                and what is more&#44; that none such can exist&#44; and that it is derogatory to God
                to suppose that He has an asso&#8211; ciate through whose means alone forgiveness
                can be vouchsafed to mankind. It may easily be imagined that there are other points
                of difference&#44; both in faith and practice&#44; between the parties &#59; but
                that on which they diverge the most&#44; is the principle just ex&#8211; hibited.
                Now we contend that our religion being from God&#44; as even our opponents
                allege&#44; must have been always coinciding with theirs&#44; if they are in the

                maintained the same idea&#44; from Moses to this time&#44; we must be right&#44; if
                even they are correct that their prophet was greater than ours. Were it now the case

                reason of our persevering as Jews. Let us refer to the history of the most
                disgraceful dereliction of which we have been guilty nationally&#44; often as we
                have oftended&#44; which is the making of the golden calf&#44; while our teacher was

                ceive the law and commandments on Mount Sinai. We had been only just taught how to
                fear and wor&#8211; ship God&#44; had been shown how great He was above all
                deities&#44; how He was alone the Sovereign of heaven and earth &#59; the fire of
                glory yet blazed on the top of the mount&#44; where the glorious Presence dwelt&#59;

                sun&#44; like sand around our camp&#58; and still we were senseless enough to
                despair of God&#39;s mercy and truth&#44; because the man Moses&#44; who had led us
                forth from Egypt&#44; had not returned so speedily as we had expected him&#59; and
                straight&#8211; ways we repaired to Aaron&#44; to ask of him&#44; &#34; Rise&#44;
                make for us gods&#44; which shall go before us &#33;&#34; and when we beheld the
                image of the Egyptiau idol&#44; the likeness of a calf&#44; we shouted&#44; &#34;

                is to say&#44; Moses&#39;s people&#44; not any more God&#39;s people&#44; &#34;

                have made themselves a molten calf&#59; and they have worshipped it&#44; and have

                associate&#39;s had etfected for us what is in the hands alone of the Creator to
                accomplish. What wonder&#44; then&#44; that the decree of destruction was pronounced
                against the sinning race&#44; that God told the prophet not to pray for them&#44;
                that they should perish even as they had despised and rejected Him &#33; Moses was
                promised that he should become the father of a great nation&#44; in order to fulfil

                narrative prove the utter condemnation of the sinner&#63; the ab&#8211; solute
                necessity of an atoning sacrifice &#63; We ask those who assert this idea&#44; to
                point their finger to the passage in the record which teaches this &#33; To our
                apprehension&#44; we are informed that sin is punished in a strict measure of
                justice&#59; bnt that the Lord can and does remit it often in his mercy&#44; without
                punish&#8211; ing to the extent of the guilt incurred&#44; and that at the same
                time&#44; when punishment has been meted out the iniquity is wiped away&#59; because
                the Merciful wishes to correct and to improve&#44; not to destroy ut&#8211; terly

                read&#44; it emphatically declares that the Lord forgave the greatest national sin
                that ever was committed&#44; without sacrifice&#44; without medi&#8211; ator&#44;
                fully and freely as ever forgiveness was accorded to sinners&#44; and the decree of
                annihilation was revoked&#44; and the covenant with Abraham&#44; Isaac&#44; and
                Jacob was not delayed in its fulfilment longer than it was required in the course of
                nature to educate a people fit to enter the land which had been promised them for
                their possession&#44; in which they were to develop the high excellence of their

                otlier source. But if tliis sliould not yet be sufficient&#44; the narrative before
                us gives us far&#8211; ther insight into the relative position of man to God. After
                Moses had obtained a temporary remission&#44; he descended the mount&#44; and coming
                unto the camp of the rebellious Israelites&#44; he saw only too palpably ful&#8211;
                filled what he had foreseen by his prophecy. There was the dancing&#44; the
                senseless ceremony of the idola&#8211; ters&#44; the idol itself&#44; and all was in
                uproar and confu&#8211; sion. &#8211;We are next told that the prophet summoned
                around him all who were true to the Lord&#58; when in&#8211; stantly all his own
                tribe flocked to receive his com&#8211; mand&#44; which was&#44; that they should
                slay every one his nearest friend who had violated the precepts of the Decalogue in
                worshipping a false god. How sore must have been the trial of that mighty mind in
                this fearful emergency &#33; To save the life of one Hebrew&#44; he had slain an
                Egyptian&#44; on account of which hejje&#8211; came a stranger to the king&#39;s
                palace&#44; and was forced to feed the flocks of Jethro in the lonely desert&#44;
                far from the habitations of man &#58; whereas&#44; now he was compelled to see three
                thousand Hebrews bleed to avenge the outraged covenant. Yet this timely se&#8211;
                verity recalled the people to their senses&#44; and the re&#8211; mainder stood
                by&#44; and learned wisdom&#44; and they felt anew that the works of the hands of
                man cannot save&#44; that they are dead&#44; without breath in their nostrils&#44;
                without sisrht in their eves. And then&#44; when the law was again triumphant&#44;
                and feeling how utterly inade&#8211; quate all which had been done was to wipe out
                the immense guiltiness of which he had been an eye&#8211;wit&#8211; ness&#44; Moses
                repaired again to the mount of God&#44; and <pb n="353"/> GOD OUR ATONEMENT. 353
                appealed anew for what he was assured was not de&#8211; served by the guilty. At the
                same time he felt con&#8211; scious&#44; meek as he was to man in general&#44;
                indifferent as he was to the opinion of the vulgar crowd&#44; that he had been
                faithful in all the varied relations of his eventful life&#59; and that if any one
                could be received&#44; he might offer himself as an acceptable sacrifice to his
                Maker&#59; and he even offered&#44; more than his life&#44; the utter forgetfulness
                of his existence&#44; so as not to be mentioned in that book where&#39; are recorded
                the mercies and deeds of God&#44; in which he&#44; the prophet&#44; had been the
                most prominent actor&#59; and he prayed in case the records of revelation should not
                contain the evidence of God&#39;s forgiveness&#44; that the name of Moses might not
                be mentioned as a participant in the brilliant scheme of the world&#39;s
                regeneration. Was ever a nobler sacrifice offered on any altar&#63; What&#44;
                compared to this&#44; is the boasted redemption on which our opponents vaunt
                themselves &#63; for there was glory&#44; a name&#44; disciples&#44; and followers
                in multitudes predi&#8211; cated on the sacrifice&#44; which&#44; moreover&#44; is
                declared to have been both necessary and voluntary. But here the prophet desired to
                sink into oblivion&#44; so it pleased not God to forgive the sin which had been
                committed against him as well as his Master. Nev&#8211; ertheless&#44; no sacrifice
                was accepted&#44; and God said &#58; &#34;Him who hath sinned against me will I blot

                &#33; In my last address I stated that our religion em&#8211; phatically denies the
                necessity of a vicarious sacrifice for the sins of mankind&#44; and that&#44; unless
                the iniquity be freely forgiven&#44; every transgressor must die for his own
                wrongdoing&#59; since there is&#44; moreover&#44; no one capable of existing who has
                the power to assume&#44; either voluntarily or by compulsion&#44; the evil which has
                been committed by others. This idea is either true or false&#59; and this again can
                only be settled by the standard which the Scriptures afibrd us&#44; and no
                other&#59; human reason is here at fault&#44; and so is all authority&#44; save only
                the words of the Most High &#59; and however ingenious the argument&#44; however the
                appeal addressed to us might show the insufficiency of our hope&#44; it is all as

                various books to authenticity&#59; for&#44; if they agree with our Bible&#44; they
                add nothing to our stock of knowledge of divine things&#44; and&#44; if they

                arbiter in the contest which Israelites have waged with unwearied courage and
                unyielding per&#8211; severance for so many years. Let us proceed then in our
                illustration. In my last address I broke off suddenly after adducing the text which
                I meant to expound&#44; which was the announce&#8211; ment of God to Moses&#58;
                &#34;Ilim who hath sinned against mc will I blot out from my book.&#34; It was
                briefly shown that&#44; overflowing with love for a sinning peo&#8211; ple&#44;
                Moses had offered himself as a sacrifice for the guilty&#44; and begged to be
                blotted out of the book of revelation in case the Lord would not consent to
                for&#8211; give their sin. To this the ever&#8211;memorable reply just <pb n="357"/>
                GOD OUR ATONEMENT. 357 quoted was given. Now does any one imagine that it was merely
                recorded for our amusement&#44; to sliow us how God answered the prayer of a
                mortal&#63; If this were so&#44; we might have expected more full de&#8211; tails of
                all which occurred during the period of three times forty days that Moses stayed on
                the mount to be taught by the Creator &#59; we ought then to have re&#8211; ceived
                some more&#44; if not all&#44; of the conversations&#44; if we may use such a
                word&#44; which took place between the Most High and his servant&#59; for it is not
                to be supposed that we are presented in the few words with which the books of the
                Law furnish us with all that happened. There must&#44; therefore&#44; be a deeper
                rea&#8211; son than the gratification of our curiosity&#44; why this answer is
                recorded among the other emanations of the will of God which the Bible contains&#59;
                and&#44; it not be&#8211; ing a commandment&#44; we may be assured that it
                con&#8211; tains an idea which it behoves us to know and to cherish. &#8212; &#34;
                Him who hath sinned against me will I blot out from my book&#59;&#34; not the
                innocent&#44; not he who beholds&#44; with grief and indignation&#44; the evil which
                is committed all around him&#44; which he would gladly check&#44; but which he feels
                himself quite power&#8211; less in arresting&#44; will be seized for the ofience of
                others&#59; but only those&#44; who have themselves trans&#8211; gressed&#44; will
                be panislied to the extent in which their deeds may claim the requital which the
                Lord will in justice decree. Now we contend that this is the whole scheme of the
                government of the world&#44; &#8211;&#8212; which means that there is a direct
                responsibility for whatever occurs under the supervision of the Supreme Ruler&#44;
                and this includes every act which mankind can perpetrate&#44; from the beginning of
                time to its end&#8211; <pb n="358"/> 358 GOD OUR ATONEMENT. ing&#44; and from one
                part of the earth to the other. Every man has to answer for his own deeds&#44; just
                as he is deserving of reward for every virtuous act which he renders his own. It is
                possible enough &#8212; nay&#44; it is true&#44; for the Bible teaches it &#8212;
                that both the good and the evil which men commit will be rewarded or pun&#8211;
                ished in others &#59; but this has another bearing than becoming a substitute for
                others&#59; since&#44; notwithstand&#8211; ing a good deed be rewarded in
                another&#44; the actor himself will not lose his reward&#44; not the minutest
                por&#8211; tion of what he can justly lay claim to&#59; whilst&#44; also&#44; should
                iniquitous children be punished in addition to their own guilt&#44; because they
                would not learn the good from seeing the visitation which overwhelmed their
                parents&#44; the guilt of these last will not the less have to be atoned for in
                their own persons. Nay&#44; the very consciousness that virtue has drawn down
                bless&#8211; ings&#44; and crime punishtiient&#44; on others&#44; must heighten the
                enjoyment of the good in receiving their own re&#8211; ward&#44; and deepen the
                debasement which the wicked experience in their own persons. There is&#44; it must
                be well understood&#44; in all discus&#8211; sions and inquiries&#44; a great danger
                of generalizing&#44; and of assuming that&#44; because one thing is true&#44;
                another is equally so&#44; for no other reason than that they re&#8211; semble each
                other. But it is evident tliat such a method would enable us to prove the greatest
                absurd&#8211; ity by some fancied or even real resemblance it bears to an admitted
                truth. It is&#44; however&#44; requisite&#44; es&#8211; pecially in matters of
                conscience&#44; that each proposi&#8211; tion should stand by itself&#44; and be
                capable of scrip&#8211; tural support without any reference to another idea&#59; and

                one may be true&#44; whilst tlie other is entirely inadmis&#8211; sible. I now
                especially allude to the doetrine of a vi&#8211; carious atonement as compared with
                the scriptural idea of a visitation of parental sins upon rebellious children. The
                last idea is laid down in the Deca&#8211; logue&#44; &#34; For I&#44; the Lord thy
                God&#44; am a jealous God&#44; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the

                pacity by outward and visible means &#59; the spiritual bond of national union&#44;

                aw&#8211; ful curses pronounced in the twenty&#8211;sixth chapter of Leviticus&#44;
                to which I would refer you. Some crimes&#44; such as drunkenness and low
                debauchery&#44; entail sick&#8211; ness and a ruined constitution upon the
                actors&#59; and often the evil effects pass over into the children &#59; and

                into activity by the fault of the present sufferers. In this instance&#44; then&#44;
                we may safely apply the interpretation of our sages&#44; who comment

                is&#44; however&#44; subject to no question or doubt&#44; but that any such an

                &#59; for the All&#8211;wise him&#8211; self has emphatically taught us not to
                endeavour to account for his conduct towards man upon mere hu&#8211; man ideas&#44;
                and by the insufficient light which we pos&#8211; sess&#44; when He said through
                Isaiah &#58; &#34; For not my thoughts are your thoughts&#44; and not your ways are
                my ways&#44; saith the Lord. For as high as the heavens are above the earth&#44; so
                high are my ways above your ways&#44; and my thoughts above your thoughts.&#34; All
                we can do is to approximate&#44; at an humble distance&#44; to the wisdom of our
                Father in heaven&#44; and to illus&#8211; trate&#44; however feebly&#44; the manner
                in which He gov&#8211; erns all. If in so doing we can catch a glimpse of his
                justice&#44; or can discover a mere trace of his right&#8211; eousness&#44; we are
                amply rewarded &#59; and we must then conclude&#44; that&#44; if in our present
                mortal condition&#44; when our soul is obscured by the dark clouds which a
                per&#8211; ishable frame throws over its brightness&#44; we can un&#8211; derstand

                will more readily seize on the new generation&#44; because they are more prepared
                for and exposed to its reception. Thus each generation of the wicked become more
                imbecile in mind and body &#59; thus each generation of effeminate and deteriorated
                civilized men&#44; composing a state&#44; sink gradually before the assault of the
                more vigor&#8211; ous barbarians&#44; who have hitherto been always ready to
                overthrow states&#44; the vitality of which had expired in the downward progress of
                self&#8211;indulgence and over&#8211; refinement. If you examine the history of
                families and nations&#44; you will find this fact clearly established&#44;
                without&#44; I think&#44; a single exception&#59; and I believe it to be so easily
                susceptible of proof&#44; that I will not de&#8211; tain you with adducing any at
                present. I trust&#44; there&#8211; fore&#44; that you have now a tolerably correct
                view of the denunciation of the Ten Commandments against the children of the
                transgressors&#44; and that it merely affirms the well&#8211;known principle&#44;
                which all experience has found to be true&#44; that the evil men do often lives
                after them. This&#44; however&#44; does not say in the re&#8211; motest degree that
                the sufferings of the first wrong&#8211; doer is in the least diminished by the
                transfer of a part of it to others &#58; in short&#44; no atonement is ob&#8211;
                tained by the number of participants in the wrong done&#44; and in the bitter fruits
                which are produced as its natural consequence. This will now give us the following
                result&#44; that there is no contradiction between the declaration in the
                Decalogue&#44; that the iniquity of the fathers shall be visited on the
                children&#44; if they both hate God&#44; and the answer given to Moses&#44; that

                in practice and its consequences to others&#44; the last as speaking of the effect
                of sin upon the transgressor&#44; irrespective of his connexion with any one beyond
                his own person. As in the Decalogue no mediator is spoken of or hinted at as
                standing between the Most High and the delin&#8211; quents&#44; so there is hone
                referred to in the second rev&#8211; elation to Moses&#44; when he stood alone in
                the presence of his Maker&#44; in the attitude of the most intensely heartfelt
                prayer. The idea is only enlarged&#44; not cir&#8211; cumscribed&#44; not to think
                of being contradicted or re&#8211; pealed&#44; and it leaves us precisely where the
                Decalogue left us&#44; with the burden of self&#8211;justification resting upon us
                and all other sons of man to the end of time. I shall no doubt be met with the
                objections&#44; &#34;How is a man to justify himself&#63; what can he do to satisfy
                his God &#63; has he any merit &#63; are his deeds of any value&#63; do they benefit
                the Supreme Being &#63; &#34; True &#59; if we solely had human reason to guide
                us&#44; if every&#8211; thing were reduced to the mere comprehension of nature and
                God by our finite senses&#44; we would be compelled to answer that man cannot
                justify himself&#59; that he can do nothing to satisfy his God&#59; that he has no
                merit&#59; that his deeds are&#44; absolutely speaking&#44; of no value &#59; since
                he can&#44; in no manner whatever&#44; benefit&#44; nor for that matter injure&#44;
                the Supreme Ruler of the universe. But we are not left to mere unassisted human
                reason to frame our course of life&#44; nor to adopt those ideas which will urge us
                on in our relig&#8211; ious and political conduct. I employ designedly the terms
                religious and political&#59; for however distinct they may seem at a first view&#44;
                they are in the pres&#8211; ent state of the world intimately connected&#44; and all

                and though there is a constant change going on in the pubHc opinion. In short&#44;
                we have a revealed word of God to direct us how to act&#44; which teaches us&#44; at
                the same time&#44; how to think. If our sound reason squares exactly with this
                superadded hght&#44; it is well&#59; for then we perceive&#44; by our own inherent
                good sense&#44; that we are not deceived. But if&#44; as it does frequently
                happen&#44; we are not able to reconcile our own thoughts with what is held up to us
                as the emanation of Su&#8211; preme &#34;Wisdom&#44; we must submit to be robbed
                even of our own preconceived opinion&#44; and adopt in its stead that which is more
                than ourselves&#44; higher than our own inventions&#44; more perfect than our own
                studies can evolve&#44; which sprung&#44; as we have the assurance of the wise and
                good&#44; from the will of God&#44; and the truth of which has been established by
                the long array of facts which history records. Whatever now this revelation teaches
                is to us&#44; as a matter of right&#44; motive for action&#44; basis for thought.
                Let us then look into it&#44; as respects our question of man&#39;s
                self&#8211;justification. Self&#8211;justification&#44; however&#44; simply means
                that if a man have done a wrong he may&#44; or must rather&#44; do some&#8211; thing
                to remedy the evil&#44; in order to be cleared in the opinion of the Supreme Judge
                from the taint of guilt which attaches to him by his own conduct. If now he has no
                means to accomplish this&#44; he cannot be asked to attempt it&#59; but if the
                Almighty has provided them&#44; no matter how difficult they may be of attain&#8211;
                ment&#44; he is in reason bound to leave nothing un&#8211; tried&#44; in order to
                remove the displeasure justly in&#8211; curred&#44; through what he has laid to his
                own charge. <pb n="365"/> GOD OUR ATONEMENT. 365 But this idea also includes the
                other&#44; that man has the means of satisfying God&#44; wherefore his deeds are
                necessarily of some value&#44; however slight&#44; and that they must be pleasing to
                the Supreme Being&#44; al&#8211; though they add nothing to his happiness. We may
                thus at once assume that&#44; where there is a possibility of pleasing or
                displeasing God&#44; there is also included the possibility at least of
                self&#8211;justification&#59; and hence it results that perseverance in a
                course&#44; which excludes acts of a renewed submission to the means granted to us
                to acquire the good&#8211;will of Heaven&#44; is as much blameworthy as doing the
                wrong in the first instance. I have thus traced for you the view we Israelites have
                necessarily to take in basing our whole religion on the Scriptures&#59; and they
                teach us accordingly that man can have merit in his conduct&#59; because God has
                commanded him to do certain acts&#44; which he can fulfil without any outward or
                inward obstruction&#44; at least none which he has not the means of overcom&#8211;
                ing if he will&#44; and which&#44; at the same time&#44; he is enabled to pretermit
                without any outward or inward force compelling him to their observance. It is
                ac&#8211; cordingly this absolute freedom of will&#44; a capacity for obedience with
                the means of disobedience in his power&#44; which gives to man&#39;s action the
                value of which we are speaking. We may also without irreverence say&#44; that he is
                here on earth an independent being so far as his will is concerned&#44; not as
                respects his ability to work out his pleasure to the full extent&#59; for in this he
                is as helpless as the imagination can possibly con&#8211; ceive. But in his
                independent capacity he is pre&#8211; sented with the will of God&#44; in whose
                world he is a subject&#44; one bound to unconditional obedience&#44; which&#44;
                31&#42; <pb n="366"/> 366 GOD OUR ATONEMENT. nevertheless&#44; he has the choice to
                refuse or to grant&#44; as he may deem proper&#59; and thus he is either pleasing or
                otherwise to his Sovereign&#44; as he of a free accord prefers one course above the
                other. The merit in his conduct is not the benefit lie confers on God&#44; because
                this idea is never presented to us in the Bible&#59; but because he could without
                force disobey&#8211;&#44; and jet pre&#8211; fers obedience. In this single
                word&#44; therefore&#44; the whole question resolves itself. God is the Creator&#44;
                infinitely great and happy&#58; man&#44; on the other hand&#44; is the creature&#44;
                limited and subject to the will of God&#44; but able to act as his own fancy may
                dictate. If he now follows the first course&#44; that is to say&#44; he is
                obe&#8211; dient&#44; he has all the merit which the Bible ascribes to righteousness
                &#59; for we know of no other measure or standard by which to estimate our acts.
                If&#44; on the contrary&#44; he follows his own fancies&#44; although in this way he
                inflicts not the slightest perceptible injury on God&#44; he offends Him and incurs
                his displeasure&#44; and in consequence all the evils which are denounced against
                the acts which he has committed. All this is predicated&#44; if his will has not
                been coerced by an out&#8211; ward force which he could not overcome&#59; but if
                this be otherwise&#44; his disobedience loses the trait of inde&#8211; pendence of
                which we just spoke&#59; he is under duress&#44; insurmountable constraint&#44;
                and&#8211; his deeds lose their quality of rebellion&#44; and therefore are not
                displeasing&#44; or at least not to the extent they would be if he acted without
                constraint. This&#44; then&#44; gives us&#44; Jirst&#44; the result n&#8211;&#39;os
                Kicn&#8211;&#34; 3i&#58;x &#34; The Merciful absolves the one who is forced to do
                wrong&#59; &#34; and&#44; secondly&#44; that with the cessation of this necessity
                the sinfulness recurs in its full vigour for every repetition of the deeds&#44;
                which <pb n="367"/> GOD OUR ATONEMENT. 367 hitherto were not worthy of blame or
                punishment. So also with act&#8211;s of obedience done under the force of
                circumstances&#44; from hypocrisy&#44; or with bad views&#59; though they be of some
                value notwithstanding their defectiveness&#44; they will not be accepted in favour
                by the Searcher of hearts&#44; on the principle&#39;y2 n2&#94; Nj&#8211;rn &#34; The
                Merciful demands the heart&#44; &#34; which means that&#44; in acquiring the habit
                of obedience to divine pre&#8211; cepts&#44; it should be from a sincere conviction
                of their truth and necessity&#44; not merely a cold and formal acquiescence&#44;
                which one would gladly be rid of&#44; if he could or dared. We have thus a standard
                of merit&#44; in the first in&#8211; stance&#44; founded upon the admitted truth of
                Scripture. But as each sin voluntarily committed is a continu&#8211; ance in
                rebellion&#44; it follows that every man should cease his acts of disobedience the
                moment he discovers or feels that he has violated the will of his God. This&#44; to
                be sure&#44; is not self&#8211;justification&#44; according to human reason&#59; for
                it might be alleged that one who has ofifended wilfully his God and Benefactor has
                no right to expect mercy and indulgence. But we do not speak of human reason &#58;
                we speak in the spirit of revelation&#59; and this says that man can repent&#59;
                that by leaving his course of evil&#44; and returning to God&#44; he will be
                pardoned by Him who abundantly forgives. I refer you to the fifty &#8211;fifth
                chapter of Isaiah&#44; where you will see this clearly established. But a mere
                change of conduct leaves justice unsatisfied&#59; man&#44; therefore&#44; has to
                submit&#44; in addition&#44; to any punish&#8211; ment which may be decreed against
                him&#44; either by the judges who occupy the place of God on earth&#44; or to the
                inflictions of the Supreme without the inter&#8211; <pb n="368"/> 368 GOD OUR

                power to repair the injury he has done&#44; and to avoid most scrupulously offending
                in future. It is naturally to he expected&#44; that no one can say how much he must
                do to atone for sin&#59; &#8212; how much he must sufier iu this process of
                self&#8211;justification &#59; but herein&#44; as in primary acts of piety&#44; he
                must of neces&#8211; sity refer the whole to the wisdom&#44; mercy&#44; and justice
                of God&#44; and wait with patience for the issue&#44; which is in tlie hands of God
                alone. It is not&#44; understand well&#44; in human reason that this is said&#44;
                but only upon the explicit teaching of Scripture&#59; and if anj&#8211; one does not
                find it enough&#44; let him ascribe the fault&#44; if fault it be&#44; not to
                Judaism&#44; as professed by us&#44; but to the Holy Bible itself. There is&#44;
                however&#44; nothing un&#8211; reasonable in it&#59; for&#44; if man can
                ofiPend&#44; as he does actually do&#44; it is at last but a finite being who does
                the wrong&#44; consequently&#44; except in rare cases&#44; be can&#8211; not ojffend
                infinitely. In general&#44; therefore&#44; all sins can&#44; if we take reason for
                our standard&#44; be atoned for&#59; and respecting the few individuals of whom the
                Bible speaks as having been the cause of a succession of sin and its consequent
                evil&#44; they may probably have to sufi&#58;&#39;er as long as the evil they have
                caused continues. But where man&#39;s wrong is confined within a narrow circle&#44;
                or rather&#44; if the evil has not pro&#8211; ceeded beyond himself&#44; why should
                he not be empow&#8211; ered by God to repair what he has destroyed&#63; And then is
                the whole idea of repentance nothing but a continuation of the justification by good
                deeds&#59; and if these have any value &#40;and who that believes in the Bible will
                deny this&#63;&#41; then must renewed obedience be also acceptable in the sight of
                God&#44; inasmuch as <pb n="369"/> GOD OUR ATONEMENT. 369 it is in accordance with
                the doctrines which He has taught us in his word. You will therefore easily
                understand&#44; without an extended argument&#44; that the sacrifices ordained for
                transgressions in the presence of the temple were merely intended as aids to
                devotion&#44; and solely ac&#8211; ceptable as they were brought in faith&#44; and
                not as assuming the sin of the transgressor&#44; which is nowhere taught in the
                Bible&#44; which only says &#58; &#34; And it shall be accepted for him&#44; to make
                an atonement for him.&#34; Lev. i. 4. But now&#44; as we have no temple where to
                bring our sacrifice&#44; we have the fullest assurance that sincere repentance&#44;
                which is more than the blood of steers and the fat of rams&#44; will be
                accepted&#44; and that the Lord God&#44; the Saviour and Creator&#44; will not cast
                off nor despise the repentant heart which pours out its sorrows before Him&#44; in
                the sincere hope of his mercy and forgiveness. Amen. Nissan 2d. &#124; 5610. March
                15th. Note. About a week after the above&#44; the last address I ever de&#8211;
                livered in the Synagogue Mikve Israel&#44; had been spoken&#44; my op&#8211; ponents
                succeeded to induce the congregation to pass a vote of cen&#8211; sure on me&#44;
                without granting me a hearing&#44; for an article which had appeared about six
                months before in the Occident&#44; my monthly magazine&#44; which could not by any
                reasonable assumption be re&#8211; garded as subject to the supervision of my
                constituents. Much as I had had to suffer before during a long ministry of
                twenty&#8211;one years&#44; this was the severest and most uncalled&#8211;for
                infliction &#59; I therefore <pb n="370"/> 370 PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM. gave up the
                function of preacher&#44; for which I had not been elected&#44; as I could not with
                any feeling of true kindness continue to address an audience&#44; who had deemed it
                advisable to pass a public vote of condemnation&#44; as their expression of what was
                due to one who had served them faithfully in every sense of the word. I did not
                resign the office of Hazan for which I had been elected&#44; and continued to the
                end of ray terra&#44; the 27th of September following. Thougli I anticipated my
                retirement from office on the just mentioned day&#44; I did not calculate on the
                sudden termination of my ministry in the manner indicated&#59; yet even on quitting
                office finally&#44; I did not once address the people in a farewell sermon&#44; so
                that no one might accuse me of the least desire to soften their ill&#8211;will by an
                appeal to former services. But the occurrence naturally prevented me from carrying
                on farther the discussion of the question of atonement&#44; barely introduced in the
                two lectures given above &#59; yet I trust that the idea has been sketched out
                sufficiently to enable any serious in&#8211; quirer to pursue the subject for
                himself with the aid of the Scrip&#8211; tures. So many years&#44; more than
                seven&#44; intervened before I en&#8211; tered again on the active ministry&#44;
                that it never occurred to me to resume the topic&#44; especially as I but rarely now
                write anything before speaking&#59; though I have not for this reason neglected to
                urge the belief in God&#39;s power and willingness to pardon the sins of his
                peo&#8211; ple on my hearers in many places in my extemporaneous addresses.

                day the annual festival of the proclamation of the Law of God on Sinai&#44; where
                amidst the convulsion of the elements an assembled people stood ready to receive the
                will of their Maker&#44; by which they were to be guided&#44; as also their
                descen&#8211; dants after them. In consequence of this it was that in every age the
                Israelites&#44; of whom we&#44; who are now present&#44; form a part&#44; did
                acknowledge their allegiance to this law&#59; and our assembling to&#8211;day to
                worship the Lord&#44; and to read the precepts which He wrote by his own divine
                power on the two tables of the covenant&#44; proves that even at this late day in

                knowledge that we also are willing to remain faithful to the law and the
                testimony&#44; which were on this day confided to the sons of Jacob. Or else why
                should we assemble &#63; Why come hither into the precincts which but a few days ago
                were declared sacred to the God of Israel &#63; Or was it a mockery that we devoted
                these walls to the worship of the Most High God&#44; the sole Lord and Creator of

                adored and adorable jSTame &#59; you felt in truth that thus you had a point of

                within the new shrine dedicated for it rested auioiig you the transcript of the law
                of the Lord your God&#44; and that it henceforward was to be there as a testimony
                against you&#44; whether indeed you love your Father in heaven with all your
                heart&#44; and with all your soul. And is it now your intention that the mere
                ceremony of dedication&#44; in which you so joyously participated&#44; is to be all
                which you mean to offer for acceptance to your God &#63; Did you say&#44; you
                desired solely once to enter his portals&#44; to show that you had a Jewish feeling
                for the solemn occasion&#44; and then to drop it again as a thing of no practical
                use&#44; as a weakness of which you had need to be ashamed&#63; If so little be your
                faith&#44; your absence would have honoured the courts of God far more than your
                pres&#8211; ence &#59; for is He not the same all the days of your life&#63; did you
                ever discover in Him any lack of prov&#8211; idence&#44; any absence of
                kindness&#44; though you have been provided for and liberally endowed all the days
                of your life &#63; Why then should you feel devotion but once&#44; or at occasions
                far apart&#44; when circumstances combine to impose on you the necessity of

                cannot be&#59; you entered this house on the day of its dedication with other

                for many&#44; many years&#44; even whilst we are compelled to dwell far from the
                once lovely land in which our fathers had their own national home&#44; where they
                    <pb n="373"/> PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM. 373 obeyed the paternal government which
                their God and King had instituted for them&#44; and whilst we are not yet recalled

                will be peace pro&#8211; claimed to all mankind&#44; and in whose days tyranny shall
                no more oppress the suffering&#44; and slavery no longer cast its galling fetters
                around the limbs of the helpless. You came hither&#44; because as Israelites you had
                long since desired to possess a house of your own&#44; where you could assemble to
                worship and adore your Father&#44; where you could have his law proclaimed in your
                hearing&#44; where you might listen to the words of admonition addressed unto you by
                the servants of God&#44; whom you may raise from time to time out of the midst of
                the people to stand in the sanctuary&#44; and to address in your behalf the throne
                of that gracious and beneficent Parent&#44; whose residence is the uni&#8211;

                the most minute acts which are done&#44; and the smallest things that exist in the
                immeasurable extent of his realm. You rejoiced that it had pleased God to excite the

                you may not sin &#40;Exod. xx. 17&#41; &#59; or&#44; in other words&#44; to teach us
                that we are subject to the will and power of God&#44; wherever we are&#44; and that
                hence we should dread doing aught which his will condemns&#44; which his revealed
                word prohibits unto us. For behold &#33; our God is not a creature&#44; like
                anything of which we have any conception&#44; who is wearied with watching&#44; or
                exhausted by labour&#59; who sees only what happens ou one spot&#44; and forgets
                that over which oblivion has waved its dusky wing&#59; since darkness darkens

                and the future are all com&#8211; bined in one&#44; &#8212; that is&#44; the
                knowledge of all possible events is clear and open before Him&#44; and because
                through his power alone all things are sustained&#44; and nothing can therefore
                escape his vengeance&#44; as all possible objects are from compulsion within his
                reach and his grasp at every moment of time. It therefore pleased Him to appear
                before our forefathers&#44; on this day which we now celebrate&#44; to impress them
                vividly with an image of his power&#44; which did not&#44; as before in Egypt and at

                which only tlie disenihodiecl spirit can attain and comprehend after the perishable
                has been changed into the eternal &#8212; after death has washed away the weakness
                and corruption incident to our earthly life. It was accordingly only to impress on
                the mind of man the knowledge that God is all&#8211;pow&#8211; erful and
                omnipresent&#44; that He is able to accomplish all and to see all that is done &#58;
                in order that upon every occasion when we are appealed to by our in&#8211; ward
                feelings to practise any act&#44; or omit doing it&#44; we may place before us the
                conviction that we are within the immediate presence of our Father&#44; who will
                either condemn and punish&#44; or approve and reward every deed or omission which we
                make our own. It is&#44; therefore&#44; evidently the business of our life&#44;
                first&#44; to learn what God has taught&#59; and secondly&#44; to omit no
                opportunity for conforming to this knowl&#8211; edge &#59; since the former would be
                useless&#44; unless the practice corresponded with it in every respect. To
                accomplish this&#44; therefore&#44; to its fullest extent&#44; it will be merely
                necessary to tell you to study carefully the words of the Scriptures which contain
                the revealed will of God&#44; &#8212; to inquire of the wise and experienced among
                you as to the manner in which the precepts should be observed&#44; and then to abide
                faithful to wliatever you have thus acquired. It will be evident&#8211; ly not my
                purpose in a simple address to recite&#44; even without commenting thereon&#44; all
                the ordinances which comprise the body of the Jewish law&#59; but I trust that you
                will indulge me a little while with your attention&#44; whilst I expatiate on the
                nature of the pre&#8211; cepts which constitute our religion. I do not expect <pb
                    n="377"/> PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM. &#34; 377 to tell you anything which yon have
                not known he&#8211; fore&#44; and which you have not often heard &#59; hut it is
                occasionally necessary to refresh the memory&#44; and to reawaken our perhaps
                slumbering ardour for what is holy and true&#59; and if he accomplishes this&#44;
                the preacher&#39;s task is done&#44; as he thus follows in the footsteps of the holy
                prophets of old&#44; and the blessed teachers of Israel in all ages&#44; who added
                nothing to and diminished nothing from the Law. Let us&#44; therefore&#44; confine
                ourselves to a brief re&#8211; view of the Ten Commandments&#44; which have been
                read to us this day whilst we were all standing to listen to them&#44; even as our
                fathers stood erect whilst the Lord himself spoke unto their bodily ears from amidst
                the fire which blazed on Iloreb. At a first view&#44; the Decalogue is divided into
                two parts&#44; faith and practice &#59; and the latter again into acts of re&#8211;
                ligion proper&#44; and deeds correctly termed moral du&#8211; ties. First&#44; as
                regards faith. Every constitution must needs have a basis on which its various
                sections are founded&#59; consequently our holy&#44; fundamental code also needed a
                resting or starting point&#44; from which all otLier specifications had to proceed.
                This basis you will find in the first precept&#44; which&#44; strange&#8211; ly
                enotigh&#44; is taken by a kindred religion as the mere prologue&#44; so to say&#44;
                to the ten precepts which we re&#8211; ceived from Sinai. Without permitting myself
                to be drawn awtiy into a long discussion of this important point&#44; it is enough
                for my present purpose to state&#44; that it is owing to a material difierence in
                our respec&#8211; tive religions&#44; that this curious distinction in the
                enumeration of the Decalogue has arisen &#59; and that the change by our opponents
                was perhaps necessary 62&#42; <pb n="378"/> 378 PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM. to them&#44;
                in order to reconcile their peculiar views with the alleged spirit of the
                Scriptures&#44; as the let&#8211; ter is confessedly entirely opposed to them. But
                to proceed &#58; We hold the first precept to be embraced in the verse
                d&#39;t&#58;&#58;&#94; jT20 oni&#39;D i&#94;f&#42;&#94; ynNvin &#34;&#94;wn
                yn&#94;x&#39;n ojn &#34;I am the Lord thy God&#44; who have brought thee out of the
                land of Egypt&#44; from the house of servitude&#59;&#34; and we consider it as a
                commandment to acknowl&#8211; edge the existence of the Deity who thus makes
                him&#8211; self known to us &#59; and we view it&#44; at the same time&#44; as the
                foundation of our whole religious system. You all know the circumstances under which
                we had dwelt for several centuries in Egypt&#59; we had been servants&#44; or slaves
                rather&#44; subject to the arbitrary will of king and people&#44; and our voice of
                complaint against cruel treatment had been received with scorn and contumely. In the
                ordinary course of events but one of two things could have produced a change in our
                position&#44; &#8212; either a successful rebellion against our masters&#44; or
                their voluntary dismissal of us from their service. Of the first method history
                furnishes&#44; perhaps&#44; an example&#44; though hardly to the extent of the
                liberation of six hundred thousand able&#8211;bodied labourers held under&#39;
                absolute subjection within the reach of the oppressors&#39; power&#59; but of the
                other we know of no parallel&#44; certainly not if we take into consideration that
                the whole mass thus redeemed left at once the land of their former sufferings. It
                was&#44; however&#44; neither our force nor our masters&#39; relenting which
                liberated us&#44; but a series of remarkable events which compelled the Egyptians to
                consent&#44; though reluctantly&#44; to let the Israelites depart&#44; as Moses had
                demanded. The residence of our ancestors in Egypt <pb n="379"/> PRINCIPLES OF
                JUDAISM. 379 is attested by other evidence than the Mosaic history&#59; their
                liberation&#44; as there recorded&#44; is the most rational way of accounting for so
                remarkable an occurrence&#44; so unlike anything known elsewhere &#59; but the most
                positive proof of the entire td&#39;uth of all recorded by Moses&#44; is to be found
                in the sudden rise of the Israel&#8211; itish nation&#44; with peculiar laws&#44;
                customs&#44; manners&#44; and sentiments&#44; so unlike all other systems then known
                to the world&#44; and since to this day nothing like it has been done to any other
                people. The going out of Egypt of our nation was accordingly a matter of the highest
                moment&#44; transcending all that had oc&#8211; &#39;curred since the flood was
                universal on the earth&#44; and swept away the sinful generation which had defiled
                it in the days of Noah &#59; and as the last was justly as&#8211; cribed to a
                superhuman agency&#44; the former also had needs to proceed from the same
                Source&#44; that is&#44; the universal Power that governs the world. If&#44;
                there&#8211; fore&#44; the Being who then spoke to us announced him&#8211; self as
                the one who had brought us out from the land of Egypt&#44; from the house of
                servitude. He at once told us that He is the all&#8211;powerful&#44; the
                all&#8211;sufiicient in himself&#44; or the Creator of all. Only to Hira who had
                ci&#39;eated and does govern all things was it practi&#8211; cable to bend the
                tyrannical heart to his will&#44; was it posaible to coerce obduracy to obedience by
                the ex&#8211; hibition of irresistible force&#59; and&#44; therefore&#44; He justly
                founds the necessity of acknowledging Him as the universal God upon the deeds of
                mercy of which we were ourselves the recipients&#44; and of the truth of which Ave
                were ourselves perfectly cognizant. For&#44; since the laws of nature were in a
                measure suspended to work the various miracles which then occurred&#44; &#8212; <pb
                    n="380"/> 380 TRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM. aud since&#44; notwithstanding this
                fact&#44; all went on har&#8211; moniously as before&#44; &#8212; since no
                convulsion of the regular course of events was observed&#44; except with regard to
                those who had been doomed to sufier&#44; as the Bible says&#44; &#34; but to all the
                children of Israel there was light in their dwellings&#44; &#34; &#8212; it argued
                conclusively that the Author alone of all&#39;things in heaven and on earth could
                have so organized nature anew for the time being&#44; as it was then observed&#44;
                which again es&#8211; tablishes the identity of our Redeemer from Egypt and the
                Creator of the universe. When&#44; therefore&#44; the first words which the Lord
                spoke to our fathers burst upon their startled ears&#44; &#34; they were at once put
                in possession of the great secret which is the basis of all creation&#59; they were
                taught to refer whatever is&#44; was&#44; or will be&#44; to one and the same
                Source&#44; to one and the same universal Power&#44; to whom all is possible&#44;
                and who alone governs ac&#8211; cording to his uncircumscribed pleasure&#44; without
                the permission&#44; control&#44; or assistance of any other being&#59; and inasmuch
                as we can fix no date to his commence&#8211; ment or termination&#44; for being
                mortal ourselves we know only the limits of our own existence&#44; we come at once
                to the conclusion that this Power is eternal&#44; no less than almighty and
                universal &#59; or&#44; in other words&#44; we were put in possession of the great
                light of our religion&#44; that God is one&#44; alone&#44; almighty&#44; and
                eternal&#44; not affected by bodily incidents&#44; and not suf&#8211; fering from
                weakness and other sorrows connected with mortal life. How great was this revelation
                &#33; how inefiable the goodness which vouchsafed it &#33; Be&#8211; hold &#33; the
                skill of the wise had for thousands of years vaiidy sought for a solution of the
                problem of nature&#59; <pb n="381"/> PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM. 381 for all search had
                ended m disappointment and un&#8211; certainty&#59; but here&#44; in a few brief
                words&#44; the Lord himself taught us his nature of oneness&#44; eternity&#44; and
                power&#44; and we have lived in this knowledge&#44; &#8212; it has become our
                faith&#44; our confidence&#44; our hope&#44; our trust&#59; and though mighty
                empires have leagued iigainst as to rob us of it&#44; we iiave constantly maintained
                it&#44; and uttered it as our battle&#8211;cry against the assaults of mankind&#44;
                and we have triumphed against our enemies in the name of the Eternal One our Father.
                This in brief is our faith&#44; as developed in the first precept of the Decalogue.
                If we next proceed to the laws of practice&#44; we shall find them twofold&#44;
                first&#44; those which impose duties or restrictions which ap&#8211; parently do not
                afi&#39;ect our fellow&#8211;men&#44; and then those which are obligatory on us as
                members of the human family at large. The first class of precepts was im&#8211;
                parted to us because we live in God&#39;s world&#44; and ought therefore to take due
                heed that we remain firm in our attachment to Him&#44; and acquire such
                thoughts&#44; as will&#44; in the best manner&#44; remove us from all those ideas
                which are inimical to an absolute acknowl&#8211; edgment of his unity and power on
                our part. Hence the prohibition of idolatry or image&#8211; worship &#59; the
                interdict against a false or useless oath by the name of God&#44; and then lastly
                the institution of the Sab&#8211; bath&#44; as a constant confession that we believe
                in the creation of the world by the free exercise of the power of the Lord&#44; made
                manifest in the va&#8211; rious material objects being called forth into active life
                or existence by his will acting through his word. The next class of ordinances
                embraces those which affect other men besides ourselves&#44; or those duties <pb
                    n="382"/> 382 PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM. which relate to man in a social state&#44;
                in his member&#8211; ship of the human family&#44; or as one of the creatures
                who&#44; equally with him&#44; are the work of an all&#8211;wise Creator. To this
                class we may reckon the last six commandments&#44; which are too familiar to all the
                world to need repeating now. But how diflerent was it when first they were announced
                &#33; simple as good morals appear to us&#44; they were not universally adopted
                among heathens&#59; and alas&#33; even among civilized communities&#44; human
                honour&#44; human life&#44; human property&#44; are not esteemed so sacred as to be
                beyond violation on the part of the evildoers&#59; or else we might dispense with

                it were otherwise&#44; which it is not&#44; and that all the moral precepts of the
                Bible were known to ancient pagans&#44; it would nevertheless not militate in the
                least against the expediency of embodying them in the Decalogue&#59; as&#44; if they
                existed at all&#44; which&#44; to a certain extent&#44; I will not deny&#44; they
                were owing to an early revelation which Noah with his sons obtained immediately
                after the flood&#44; and may&#44; for all we can allege to the con&#8211; trary&#44;
                have been imparted even to Adam&#44; our first parent. Enough for us it is to
                know&#44; that the revela&#8211; tion which we have in our hands enjoins brotherly
                love&#44; neighbourly kindness&#44; and filial obedience&#44; not as mere expedients
                to make life pass pleasantly&#44; but as acts of resignation to the Avill of
                God&#44; who&#44; being the Father of all&#44; commands his children to love one the
                other. But as the religious and civil laws are based on the same original
                foundation&#44; that is&#44; the will of God&#44; there can evidently be no rational
                differ&#8211; ence as regards their relative importance to us&#44; unless <pb

                intentions and thought of the Creator&#44; except through means of his revealed
                word. But as we have none such&#44; it follows that to us Israelites the religious
                and moral laws&#44; as also those which enjoin an absolute faith or belief in
                God&#44; are all alike holy&#44; important&#44; necessary&#44; and useful&#44; and
                that we can accordingly not lay claim to the title of religious men&#44; or expect
                to obtain the blessing of God&#44; unless we obey Him in every partic&#8211;
                ular&#44; and be truly that which his Word desires us to be. The exposition of our
                religion&#44; thus laid before you&#44; is so simple and self&#8211;evident&#44;
                that I trtist that should any one not have been convinced before&#44; he will now
                acknowledge that&#44; to be a true Israelite&#44; he must do what our ancestors
                promised in the wilder&#8211; ness&#44; &#34; All the words which the Lord hath
                spoken will we do.&#34; There should be no reserve&#44; no choosing between one
                observance and the other&#44; no rejecting of this as useless&#44; of that as
                obsolete&#44; or of the other as incompatible with the fickle spirit of the age. Our
                religion in its essentials knows nothing of progress&#44; nothing of
                retrogression&#59; it is the emanation of the Deity who&#44; in his own wisdom&#44;
                granted it unto us&#44; a guide to our feet and a light on our path through the
                toilsome journey of life. How then shall we sit in judgment on the Scriptures&#44;
                or even the teachings of our venerated sages&#44; to reform&#44; as it is called
                nowa&#8211; days&#44; the practices which have distinguished us from the very first

                where universal re&#8211; ligious freedom prevails&#44; a consistent religious
                char&#8211; acter and a devotion to the interests of Israel. All that a stranger
                among you can do is to reiterate the admonition. Be then true to your God&#44; as He
                has been faithful in his promises. He declared through his messengers that He never
                would cast ofl&#39; Israel abso&#8211; lutely and entirely&#44; though their
                transgressions should be great and manifold. How truly has this been ful&#8211;
                filled &#33; See how fearful is the measure of our in&#8211; iquity&#59; behold how
                little regarded are the sacred precept&#59; how many violate the Sabbath&#59;
                despise the festivals&#59; eat what the law interdicts&#44; and join in marriage
                those who owe no fealty to Jacob&#39;s God. And what is more&#44; how many are there
                who affect to doubt the ultimate fulfilment of God&#39;s promises&#44; and would
                desire no better fate than to be lost and ab&#8211; sorbed gradually amidst the
                nations&#44; that not long since were ready to slay and torture the fairest&#44; and
                best&#44; and wisest of the daughters and sons of Jeshu&#8211; run. Yes&#44; were it
                not for the mercy of God which&#44; undeserving as we are&#44; protects us&#44;
                fearful evils would in modern times have been sent over us&#44; even as it was in
                those terrible periods when the two houses of God at Jerusalem fell respectively
                under the assaults of Nebuchadnezzar the Babylonian&#44; and Titus&#44; falsely
                called the merciful Emperor of Rome. But be ad&#8211; monished &#8212; let the
                seeming security not deceive you&#59; the Lord is long&#8211;suffering&#44; but
                He&#44; at the same time&#44; allows not the guilty to pass unpunished. Fly the
                wrath whilst yet it is time&#44; seek for mercy whilst it yet may be obtained&#44;
                and delay not to strive for the forgiveness of our Father on high&#44; whose portals
                are <pb n="385"/> PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM. 385 always open to receive those who hasten
                thither for shelter from the gathering storin&#44; whose hand is ever stretched
                forth to snatch from the frownins&#58; billows those who call to Him for help from
                the depth of their sorrow. Do this&#44; brothers of Israel &#33; do this&#44;
                sisters of the house of Jacob &#33; and excuse not your present sin by the futile
                plea that hitherto you have acted as you do now &#59; for how can you ask of God to
                be accepted by Him&#44; whilst you will make your own pleasure the guide of your
                life &#63; There is but one road of salvation to us who are called by the name of
                Israel&#44; and this is a strict obedience to the law. Let this but prevail among
                you &#59; be only distinguished in this community as faithful servants of the Most
                High&#44; and you need not tremble when disease and death invade your dwelling&#44;
                or when the current of your success is arrested&#44; and days of worldly evil come
                over you. For then you will recognize the finger of God in all which befalls
                you&#44; and you will have the for&#8211; titude&#44; the endurance to bear in the
                strength of faith and filial resignation whatever He may decree con&#8211; cerning
                you &#59; and though your eye may weep&#44; and your heart be ready to break&#44;
                you will rise above yourselves&#44; conquer even death in the triumph of hope&#44;
